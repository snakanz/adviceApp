# 🚀 START HERE - Recall.ai Webhook Deployment

## ✅ What's Done

Your Recall.ai webhook handler has been **completely fixed and is ready to deploy**.

**Problem:** All 209+ webhooks were failing because the code was looking for the wrong header format.

**Solution:** Updated to use correct SVIX headers with proper signature verification.

---

## 🎯 Deploy in 3 Steps

### **Step 1: Push Code to GitHub** (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/Nelson/adviceApp
git add backend/src/routes/recall-webhooks.js
git commit -m "Fix: Update Recall webhook handler for SVIX signature verification"
git push origin main
```

✅ Render will automatically redeploy

### **Step 2: Wait for Deployment** (2-3 minutes)

Go to https://dashboard.render.com and watch the logs.

Look for:
```
✅ Recall V2 routes mounted successfully
```

### **Step 3: Verify It Works** (1 minute)

Test the endpoint:
```bash
curl https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/webhooks/webhook/test
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "environment": {
    "webhookSecretConfigured": true,
    "apiKeyConfigured": true,
    "supabaseConfigured": true
  }
}
```

## 🎉 What Happens Next

Once deployed:

1. ✅ Recall.ai automatically retries all 209+ failed webhooks
2. ✅ Webhooks now pass signature verification
3. ✅ Transcripts are fetched and stored
4. ✅ Meetings are updated with transcript content
5. ✅ AI summaries are generated

---

## 📊 Expected Logs

In Render logs, you'll see:

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║         RECALL.AI WEBHOOK RECEIVED                         ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

📨 ALL REQUEST HEADERS:
   svix-id: msg_34lS62CrglRCDI6Kc1PWIdcDgV
   svix-timestamp: 1761918396
   svix-signature: v1,sLw4Vni1BhiXXOUgnBsuq87x0Xz5Qk4z85Q1lDaCiuMWo=

🔑 Webhook Secret: ✅ Configured

🔐 Verifying SVIX signature...
✅ SIGNATURE VALID

✅ Webhook event recorded
🎯 Processing event type: transcript.done
✅ Transcript retrieved
✅ WEBHOOK PROCESSING COMPLETE
```

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After deployment:

- [ ] Render logs show "✅ Recall V2 routes mounted successfully"
- [ ] Test endpoint returns 200 with all environment variables configured
- [ ] Render logs show "✅ SIGNATURE VALID" messages
- [ ] Recall.ai dashboard shows webhooks changing from Failed → Success
- [ ] `recall_webhook_events` table has new entries
- [ ] `meetings` table has transcripts populated

## 🔍 If Something Goes Wrong

### **Webhooks still failing?**

1. **Check environment variables in Render**
   - Go to Render Dashboard → Backend Service → Environment
   - Verify `RECALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set
   - Should start with `whsec_`

2. **Check logs for errors**
   - `❌ SIGNATURE INVALID` → Secret doesn't match
   - `❌ Missing SVIX headers` → Headers not being sent
   - `❌ RECALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET not set` → Environment variable missing

3. **Force redeploy**
   - Go to Render Dashboard
   - Click three dots (⋯) → **Reboot**
   - Wait 2-3 minutes

## 🎯 What Was Changed

**File: `backend/src/routes/recall-webhooks.js`**

- ✅ New `verifySvixSignature()` function (lines 8-93)
- ✅ Enhanced `fetchTranscriptFromRecall()` function (lines 95-154)
- ✅ Updated main webhook endpoint (lines 273-388)
- ✅ Enhanced test endpoint (lines 393-410)

**Key Fixes:**
- ✅ Reads correct SVIX headers (`svix-id`, `svix-timestamp`, `svix-signature`)
- ✅ Decodes base64 secret from `whsec_` prefix
- ✅ Uses HMAC-SHA256 with base64 digest
- ✅ Constant-time signature comparison
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

---

## 🚀 Ready?

**Run this command to deploy:**

```bash
cd /Users/Nelson/adviceApp && git add backend/src/routes/recall-webhooks.js && git commit -m "Fix: Update Recall webhook handler for SVIX signature verification" && git push origin main
```

Then wait 2-3 minutes and check Render logs for success! 🎉
