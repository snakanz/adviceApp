# Calendar Sync & Authentication Fixes - Summary

## Overview
Fixed critical issues with Calendly and Google Calendar integration for user `snaka1003@gmail.com` that were preventing meetings from displaying and causing re-authorization loops.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Calendly Data After Login
**Problem**: Previously synced Calendly meetings and clients were not displaying despite existing in the database.

**Root Cause**: `calendarService.listMeetings()` was only querying the Google Calendar API, not the database.

**Solution**: Modified `backend/src/services/calendar.js` to query the database for all meeting sources (Google, Calendly, manual, Outlook) instead of calling external APIs.

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/services/calendar.js` - `listMeetings()` function now queries database

### 2. ✅ Calendly Re-authorization Loop
**Problem**: System was not persisting Calendly authorization state, triggering fresh auth flow on every login.

**Root Cause**: 
- OAuth callback was using `window.location.href` causing full page redirects
- No proper popup window handling
- Missing postMessage communication between popup and parent window

**Solution**: 
- Updated `src/components/CalendarSettings.js` to open OAuth in popup window
- Implemented postMessage listener for OAuth completion
- Added popup auto-close after successful auth
- Updated `backend/src/routes/calendar.js` OAuth callback to send HTML with postMessage

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/CalendarSettings.js` - OAuth popup handling
- `backend/src/routes/calendar.js` - OAuth callback response

### 3. ✅ OAuth Popup Window UX Problem
**Problem**: Separate popup window opens during auth, main window shows as logged in, but user remains on popup creating confusion.

**Solution**: Popup now auto-closes after successful authentication and parent window receives postMessage notification.

### 4. ✅ Calendar Connection State Not Persisted/Displayed
**Problem**: System didn't remember or display which calendar source was connected.

**Solution**: 
- Added `activeProvider` state tracking in `src/components/ConnectedIntegrations.js`
- Implemented visual indicators showing active calendar with green highlight and "ACTIVE" badge
- Fetch connection status from `/api/calendar-connections` endpoint

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/ConnectedIntegrations.js` - Connection status display

### 5. ✅ Authentication Failures with No Error Messages
**Problem**: Recurring authentication failures with unclear error messages.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed `backend/src/routes/calendly.js` to use proper Supabase auth middleware
- Fixed `/api/dev/meetings` endpoint to use Supabase user ID directly (UUID) instead of looking up by email
- Improved error logging and user feedback

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/routes/calendly.js` - Replaced custom JWT auth with Supabase middleware
- `backend/src/index.js` - Fixed `/api/dev/meetings` endpoint to use Supabase user ID

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
- `users.id`: UUID (from Supabase Auth)
- `meetings.user_id`: UUID (references users.id)
- `calendar_connections.user_id`: UUID
- `calendar_connections.is_active`: BOOLEAN (only one active per user)

### Authentication Flow
1. Frontend sends Supabase JWT token in Authorization header
2. Backend verifies token using `verifySupabaseToken()`
3. Backend uses `user.id` (UUID) directly from Supabase
4. Database queries filter by `user_id` (UUID)

### Single Source of Truth
- All meetings retrieved from database, not external APIs
- Database includes Google Calendar, Calendly, manual, and Outlook meetings
- Deletion state tracked with `is_deleted` column
- Meeting source tracked with `meeting_source` column

## Files Modified

1. **backend/src/routes/calendly.js**
   - Removed custom JWT authentication (lines 12-26)
   - Added import: `const { authenticateSupabaseUser } = require('../middleware/supabaseAuth');`

2. **backend/src/index.js**
   - Fixed `/api/dev/meetings` endpoint (lines 541-545)
   - Changed from looking up user by email to using Supabase user ID directly

3. **src/components/CalendarSettings.js**
   - Updated `handleConnectCalendlyOAuth()` to use popup window
   - Added postMessage listener for OAuth completion
   - Implemented popup auto-close

4. **backend/src/routes/calendar.js**
   - Updated Calendly OAuth callback to send HTML with postMessage

5. **src/components/ConnectedIntegrations.js**
   - Added active provider state tracking
   - Implemented visual indicators for active calendar

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login with snaka1003@gmail.com
- [ ] Verify Calendly meetings display correctly
- [ ] Confirm no re-authorization loop occurs
- [ ] Check visual indicators show correct calendar source
- [ ] Verify meetings persist across sessions
- [ ] Test OAuth popup opens and closes properly
- [ ] Verify error messages display for auth failures
- [ ] Test with multiple calendar sources (Google + Calendly)

## Next Steps

1. Deploy changes to staging environment
2. Test with snaka1003@gmail.com user
3. Verify webhook-based incremental sync is working
4. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
5. Monitor for any remaining authentication issues
