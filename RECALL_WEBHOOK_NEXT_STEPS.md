# üöÄ RECALL.AI WEBHOOK - NEXT STEPS

**Status:** Code deployed ‚úÖ  
**Commit:** `af18e6a`  
**Next:** Run database migration + verify

---

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (5 minutes)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Run Database Migration
Go to **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **SQL Editor** ‚Üí **New Query**

Copy and paste:
```sql
-- Add payload column to recall_webhook_events
ALTER TABLE recall_webhook_events
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payload JSONB DEFAULT NULL;

-- Add index for better query performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_recall_webhook_events_event_type 
ON recall_webhook_events(event_type);

-- Verify it worked
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'recall_webhook_events' 
ORDER BY column_name;
```

Click **Run** and wait for success ‚úÖ

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Render Deployment
Go to **Render Dashboard** ‚Üí Your Advicly service ‚Üí **Logs**

Look for (should appear within 2-3 minutes):
```
‚úÖ Recall V2 routes mounted successfully
```

If you see errors, check:
- `RECALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set in Environment
- `RECALL_API_KEY` is set in Environment

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Check Webhook Events Table
In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
```sql
SELECT 
  webhook_id,
  bot_id,
  event_type,
  status,
  created_at
FROM recall_webhook_events 
WHERE bot_id = '1135ddc6-6116-490b-a88e-1f2e2e737c23'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected:** You should see webhook events from your test meeting

---

## üß™ TESTING (10 minutes)

### Test 1: Verify Webhook Payload Storage
```sql
SELECT 
  webhook_id,
  event_type,
  status,
  payload,
  created_at
FROM recall_webhook_events 
WHERE bot_id = '1135ddc6-6116-490b-a88e-1f2e2e737c23'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected:** `payload` column should contain JSON data like:
```json
{
  "status": "done"
}
```

---

### Test 2: Check Render Logs for Webhook Processing
In Render logs, search for:
```
üì• Received Recall webhook: transcript.done
üìã Full payload: { ... }
‚úÖ Transcript retrieved. Length: 1234 characters
‚úÖ Transcript stored for meeting 473
```

---

### Test 3: Verify Transcript in Database
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  recall_bot_id,
  recall_status,
  transcript_source,
  LENGTH(transcript) as transcript_length,
  quick_summary
FROM meetings 
WHERE recall_bot_id = '1135ddc6-6116-490b-a88e-1f2e2e737c23';
```

**Expected:**
- `recall_status` = `'completed'`
- `transcript_source` = `'recall'`
- `transcript` = populated with text
- `quick_summary` = populated (if AI processing completed)

---

## üîç DEBUGGING CHECKLIST

If webhooks still aren't working:

### ‚ùå Problem: No webhook events in table
**Solution:**
1. Check Recall.ai dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Activity
2. Look for your endpoint URL
3. Check error rate (should be 0%)
4. If errors, click on failed event to see error message

### ‚ùå Problem: "Invalid signature" errors in logs
**Solution:**
1. Verify `RECALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Render environment
2. Go to Recall.ai dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API Keys
3. Copy the webhook secret exactly
4. Update in Render environment variables
5. Redeploy

### ‚ùå Problem: "No meeting found for bot" errors
**Solution:**
1. Verify meeting exists in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, recall_bot_id FROM meetings WHERE id = 473;
   ```
2. Verify `recall_bot_id` matches webhook `bot_id`
3. If missing, the bot creation failed earlier

### ‚ùå Problem: Transcript not appearing
**Solution:**
1. Check if `transcript.done` webhook was received
2. Check Render logs for "Fetching transcript from Recall"
3. If error, check API key is correct
4. Verify bot has `recording_id` in Recall.ai dashboard

## üìä MONITORING QUERIES

### Recent Webhook Events
```sql
SELECT 
  event_type,
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  MAX(created_at) as latest
FROM recall_webhook_events 
GROUP BY event_type, status
ORDER BY latest DESC;
```

### Meetings with Recall Bots
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  recall_bot_id,
  recall_status,
  transcript_source,
  CASE WHEN transcript IS NOT NULL THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END as has_transcript,
  CASE WHEN quick_summary IS NOT NULL THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END as has_summary,
  created_at
FROM meetings 
WHERE recall_bot_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Webhook Error Rate
```sql
SELECT 
  bot_id,
  event_type,
  COUNT(*) as total_events,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'error' THEN 1 END) as error_count,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'error' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as error_rate_percent
FROM recall_webhook_events 
GROUP BY bot_id, event_type
ORDER BY error_rate_percent DESC;
```
