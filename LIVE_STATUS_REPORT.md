## 🔐 SECURITY STATUS

### Row Level Security ✅
```
✅ RLS Enabled on calendar_connections
✅ SELECT Policy: user_id = auth.uid()
✅ INSERT Policy: user_id = auth.uid()
✅ UPDATE Policy: user_id = auth.uid()
✅ DELETE Policy: user_id = auth.uid()

Result: Users can ONLY see/modify their own connections
```

### Multi-Tenant Isolation ✅
```
✅ Each user has unique user_id (UUID)
✅ Each tenant has unique tenant_id (UUID)
✅ RLS policies enforce isolation
✅ JWT token verification required
✅ User-scoped database clients

Result: Complete data isolation between users
```

### Token Security ✅
```
✅ Tokens stored in database (encrypted at application level)
✅ Refresh tokens stored separately
✅ Token expiration tracked
✅ Automatic token refresh on use
✅ Tokens never exposed in URLs

Result: Secure token management
```
