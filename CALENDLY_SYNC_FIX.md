# Calendly Sync Fix - Canceled Meetings & Duplicates

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ ClientExtractionService Constructor Error
**Error**: `TypeError: ClientExtractionService is not a constructor`

**Root Cause**: 
- `clientExtraction.js` exports a singleton instance: `module.exports = new ClientExtractionService()`
- `calendlyService.js` was trying to use it as a constructor: `new ClientExtractionService()`

**Fix**: Changed import to use the singleton instance directly
```javascript
// Before
const ClientExtractionService = require('./clientExtraction');
const clientExtraction = new ClientExtractionService(); // ❌ Error

// After
const clientExtractionService = require('./clientExtraction');
await clientExtractionService.extractClientsFromMeetings(userId); // ✅ Works
```

### 2. ❌ Canceled Meetings Still Showing
**Problem**: 
- Meetings canceled in Calendly were still appearing in the Advicly UI
- No way to detect which meetings were canceled vs active
- Potential for duplicates when meetings are rescheduled

**Root Cause**:
- Sync was only fetching `status: 'active'` events from Calendly API
- Canceled events were never detected or marked as deleted
- Database had stale data showing meetings that no longer exist

**Fix**: Comprehensive sync that handles both active AND canceled events

## How It Works Now

### Fetch Strategy
```javascript
// Fetch BOTH active and canceled events
const activeEvents = await fetchEventsByStatus(userUri, timeMin, timeMax, 'active');
const canceledEvents = await fetchEventsByStatus(userUri, timeMin, timeMax, 'canceled');
```

### Processing Logic

#### Active Events
For each active event from Calendly:

1. **New Meeting** → Create in database
   ```
   ✅ Created new meeting: Client Review
   ```

2. **Existing Meeting** → Update with latest data
   ```
   🔄 Updated active meeting: Investment Discussion
   ```

3. **Previously Deleted** → Restore and update (meeting was rescheduled)
   ```
   ♻️  Restored previously deleted meeting: Portfolio Review
   ```

#### Canceled Events
For each canceled event from Calendly:

1. **Exists in Database** → Mark as deleted
   ```sql
   UPDATE meetings SET 
     is_deleted = true,
     sync_status = 'canceled',
     updatedat = NOW()
   WHERE googleeventid = 'calendly_abc123'
   ```
   ```
   🗑️  Marked as canceled: Annual Review
   ```

2. **Never Synced** → Skip (no action needed)
   ```
   ⏭️  Skipping canceled event that was never synced: Old Meeting
   ```

### Database State

After sync, the database accurately reflects Calendly:

| Meeting | Calendly Status | Database State |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Active meeting | `active` | `is_deleted: false, sync_status: 'active'` |
| Canceled meeting | `canceled` | `is_deleted: true, sync_status: 'canceled'` |
| Rescheduled meeting | `active` (new UUID) | Old: deleted, New: active |

## Benefits

### ✅ No More Duplicates
- Canceled meetings are properly marked as deleted
- Rescheduled meetings create new entries (new UUID)
- Old entries are marked deleted, new ones are active

### ✅ Real-Time Accuracy
- Database reflects actual Calendly state
- Canceled meetings don't show in UI (filtered by `is_deleted: false`)
- Automatic sync every 15 minutes keeps data fresh

### ✅ Proper Handling of Edge Cases

**Case 1: Meeting Rescheduled**
```
Original: Meeting A (UUID: abc123) - 2pm Monday
Rescheduled: Meeting A (UUID: xyz789) - 3pm Tuesday

Result:
- abc123 → marked as canceled/deleted
- xyz789 → created as new active meeting
```

**Case 2: Meeting Canceled Then Rebooked**
```
1. Meeting created (UUID: abc123)
2. Meeting canceled → abc123 marked deleted
3. New meeting booked (UUID: def456) → created as new

Result:
- abc123 → is_deleted: true
- def456 → is_deleted: false (shows in UI)
```

**Case 3: Meeting Restored**
```
1. Meeting canceled → marked deleted
2. Meeting uncanceled (appears as active again)

Result:
- Meeting restored: is_deleted: false, sync_status: 'active'
```

## Sync Results

The sync now provides detailed feedback:

```javascript
{
  synced: 5,      // New meetings created
  updated: 12,    // Existing meetings updated
  deleted: 3,     // Meetings marked as canceled
  restored: 1,    // Previously deleted meetings restored
  errors: 0,      // Any errors encountered
  message: "Synced 5 new, updated 12, deleted 3, restored 1 meetings from Calendly"
}
```

## UI Impact

### Before Fix
```
Meetings List:
- Active Meeting 1 ✅
- Active Meeting 2 ✅
- Canceled Meeting ❌ (shouldn't show)
- Rescheduled Meeting (old) ❌ (duplicate)
- Rescheduled Meeting (new) ✅
```

### After Fix
```
Meetings List:
- Active Meeting 1 ✅
- Active Meeting 2 ✅
- Rescheduled Meeting (new) ✅

(Canceled and old rescheduled meetings are filtered out)
```

## Testing

### Verify Canceled Meetings Are Hidden

1. **Cancel a meeting in Calendly**
2. **Wait for sync** (up to 15 minutes, or trigger manually)
3. **Check UI** - meeting should disappear
4. **Check database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT title, is_deleted, sync_status 
   FROM meetings 
   WHERE googleeventid = 'calendly_YOUR_UUID';
   ```
   Should show: `is_deleted: true, sync_status: 'canceled'`

### Verify Rescheduled Meetings Work

1. **Reschedule a meeting in Calendly**
2. **Wait for sync**
3. **Check UI** - should see only the new time, not the old one
4. **Check database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT title, starttime, is_deleted, googleeventid 
   FROM meetings 
   WHERE title LIKE '%Your Meeting%'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```
   Should show:
   - Old UUID: `is_deleted: true`
   - New UUID: `is_deleted: false` with new time

### Manual Sync Test

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-backend.com/api/calendly/sync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully synced X Calendly meetings",
  "sync_result": {
    "synced": 5,
    "updated": 12,
    "deleted": 3,
    "restored": 1,
    "errors": 0
  }
}
```

## Database Schema

The sync uses these fields to track meeting state:

```sql
meetings {
  googleeventid: 'calendly_abc123',  -- Unique Calendly event ID
  is_deleted: false,                  -- true = canceled/deleted
  sync_status: 'active',              -- 'active', 'canceled', 'deleted'
  meeting_source: 'calendly',         -- Source of the meeting
  last_calendar_sync: '2025-10-17',   -- Last sync timestamp
  calendly_event_uuid: 'abc123',      -- Calendly UUID
  calendly_event_uri: 'https://...'   -- Full Calendly URI
}
```

## Deployment

✅ **Deployed**: Changes are live on Render

The fix will take effect:
