- **Account:** nelson.greenwood@sjpp.co.uk
- **Active:** Yes
- **Syncing:** Automatic webhook-based sync working

### 3. ✅ Consolidated Authentication
- **Removed:** 3 duplicate middleware definitions
- **Centralized:** All routes now use consistent middleware
- **Benefit:** Single source of truth for authentication

### 4. ✅ Deployed to Production
- **Commits:** 2 commits pushed to main
- **Backend:** Auto-deployed on Render
- **Status:** Live and operational

## Technical Changes

### Commit 1: `44a74ea`
```
Fix: Use local JWT verification instead of API calls in authentication middleware
- Changed authenticateSupabaseUser to use verifySupabaseToken()
- Changed optionalSupabaseAuth to use verifySupabaseToken()
- Fixes 401 errors on endpoints like /api/calendar-connections
- Matches the working approach used in /api/dev/meetings endpoint
- Improves performance by avoiding unnecessary API calls
```

### Commit 2: `988a200`
```
Fix: Consolidate authentication middleware across all routes
- Removed duplicate authenticateSupabaseUser from dataImport.js
- Removed duplicate authenticateSupabaseUser from notifications.js
- Removed duplicate authenticateSupabaseUser from clientDocuments.js
- All routes now use centralized middleware from supabaseAuth.js
- Ensures all endpoints benefit from the JWT verification fix
```
