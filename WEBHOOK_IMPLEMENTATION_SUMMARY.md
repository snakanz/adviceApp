# Webhook Implementation Summary

## What Changed

### ✅ Automatic Sync is Now Live
Your Google Calendar now syncs **automatically** without any manual action needed!

### ❌ Removed
- Manual "Sync Calendar" button from Meetings page
- Manual sync function from frontend
- User had to click button to sync

### ✅ Added
- Automatic webhook setup when connecting Google Calendar
- Real-time sync when calendar events change
- Automatic webhook cleanup when disconnecting
- Webhook renewal every 7 days (automatic)

## How It Works Now

### Step 1: Connect Google Calendar
```
User goes to Settings → Calendar Integrations
User clicks "Connect Google Calendar"
User completes Google OAuth flow
```

### Step 2: Automatic Webhook Setup
```
Backend receives OAuth tokens
Backend creates calendar_connections entry
Backend automatically sets up Google Calendar webhook ✨
Google confirms webhook subscription
✅ Automatic sync is now active
```

### Step 3: Real-Time Sync
```
User creates/edits/deletes event in Google Calendar
Google sends webhook notification to Advicly
Backend receives notification
Backend syncs changed events to database
✅ Meetings appear in Advicly automatically
```

### Step 4: Disconnect
```
User clicks "Disconnect" in Settings
Backend stops webhook subscription
Google stops sending notifications
✅ Sync is disabled
```

## Benefits

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Sync Method** | Manual button click | Automatic webhook |
| **User Action** | Click button every time | None - fully automatic |
| **Sync Latency** | Manual (whenever user clicks) | Real-time (< 5 seconds) |
| **API Calls** | Every sync attempt | Only when calendar changes |
| **Setup** | Manual sync button visible | Automatic on connection |
| **Disconnection** | Manual button | Automatic cleanup |

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
1. **Updated GoogleCalendarWebhookService**
   - Now uses `calendar_connections` table (not deprecated `users` table)
   - Reads OAuth tokens from correct location
   - Properly handles token expiration

2. **Automatic Webhook Setup**
   - Triggered in `/auth/google/callback` after connection created
   - Also triggered when updating existing connection
   - Non-fatal if webhook setup fails (connection still works)

3. **Automatic Webhook Cleanup**
   - Triggered in `DELETE /api/calendar-connections/:id`
   - Stops Google Calendar webhook subscription
   - Removes watch channel from database

4. **Webhook Endpoint**
   - `POST /api/calendar/webhook` receives Google notifications
   - Verifies channel ID is valid
   - Syncs changed events automatically
   - Returns 200 immediately (Google requirement)

### Frontend Changes
1. **Removed Sync Button**
   - Deleted `syncGoogleCalendar` function
   - Removed "Sync Calendar" button from header
   - Removed `isSyncing` state

2. **Simplified UI**
   - No loading spinner for sync
   - No sync status messages
   - Cleaner Meetings page header

### Database Changes
1. **New Migration**
   - `025_update_calendar_watch_channels_for_uuid.sql`
   - Updates `calendar_watch_channels` table for UUID support
   - Adds RLS policies for security
   - Creates indexes for performance

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
```sql
-- Go to Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy and run: backend/migrations/025_update_calendar_watch_channels_for_uuid.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Backend
```bash
# Already deployed via git push
# Render auto-deploys on push to main
```

### 3. Deploy Frontend
```bash
# Already deployed via git push
# Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys on push to main
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
- Check Render logs for webhook setup messages
- Check Cloudflare Pages deployment status
- Test calendar connection in Settings

## Troubleshooting

### Meetings Not Syncing
1. Check if Google Calendar is connected in Settings
2. Check backend logs for webhook setup messages
3. Try reconnecting Google Calendar
4. Check if sync is enabled (toggle in Settings)

### Webhook Not Receiving Notifications
1. Verify backend URL is correct in environment variables
2. Check Render deployment is active
3. Check for firewall/network issues
4. Try reconnecting to reset webhook

### Duplicate Meetings
1. Should not happen with webhook-only sync
2. Database has unique constraint on `googleeventid`
3. If duplicates appear, check logs for errors

## Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Webhook Renewal Monitoring**
   - Add scheduled job to check webhook expiration
   - Proactively renew before expiration

2. **Sync Status Dashboard**
   - Show last sync time in Settings
   - Show webhook status and expiration

3. **Sync History**
   - Track what was added/updated/deleted
   - Show sync history in UI

4. **Error Recovery**
   - Automatic retry on sync failure
   - Alert user if sync fails repeatedly

## Support
