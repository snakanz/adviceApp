## 🔄 How It Works

### User Login Flow
```
1. User logs in
   ↓
2. Frontend detects SIGNED_IN event
   ↓
3. Frontend calls POST /api/auth/verify-webhooks
   ↓
4. Backend checks if Calendly webhook is active
   ↓
5. Backend returns webhook status
   ↓
6. Frontend logs status (console)
   ↓
7. User sees Calendar Settings with correct sync status
```

### Calendar Settings Flow
```
1. User opens Calendar Settings
   ↓
2. Component loads connections
   ↓
3. Fetches webhook status for each connection
   ↓
4. Displays status indicators (⚡ or 🕐)
   ↓
5. Every 30 seconds: refresh webhook status
   ↓
6. UI updates automatically if status changes
```
