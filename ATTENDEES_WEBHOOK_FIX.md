# Critical Fix: Google Calendar Webhook Attendees Bug

**Commit**: `ec1c1d2`  
**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Deployed to production

---

## The Bug

The Google Calendar webhook sync was **not capturing attendees** from calendar events, causing a cascade of failures:

### Symptoms
- ❌ Meetings had `attendees: null` in database
- ❌ Client extraction service couldn't find attendees
- ❌ No clients were automatically created/linked
- ❌ LinkClientDialog showed "No clients found"
- ❌ Action items couldn't be linked to clients
- ❌ Email-first architecture broken

### Root Cause

**Two different sync services with inconsistent behavior:**

1. **`calendarSync.js`** (Batch sync) - ✅ CORRECT
   - Line 410: `attendees: JSON.stringify(calendarEvent.attendees || [])`
   - Properly captured attendees

2. **`googleCalendarWebhook.js`** (Real-time webhook) - ❌ BROKEN
   - Line 430-447: `transformEventToMeeting()` function
   - **Missing the `attendees` field entirely**
   - Meetings synced via webhook had no attendee data

### Why This Matters

Your meetings are synced via **webhook** (real-time), not batch sync. The webhook handler was stripping out attendees, so:
- All new meetings had `attendees: null`
- Client extraction couldn't work
- The entire linking system failed

---

## The Fix

**File**: `backend/src/services/googleCalendarWebhook.js`  
**Function**: `transformEventToMeeting()` (line 430-447)

**Added one line:**
```javascript
attendees: JSON.stringify(event.attendees || []),
```

**Before (BROKEN):**
```javascript
return {
  user_id: userId,
  external_id: event.id,
  title: event.summary || 'Untitled Meeting',
  starttime: startTime,
  endtime: endTime,
  location: event.location || null,
  description: event.description || null,
  meeting_source: 'google',
  is_deleted: false,
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
};
```

**After (FIXED):**
```javascript
return {
  user_id: userId,
  external_id: event.id,
  title: event.summary || 'Untitled Meeting',
  starttime: startTime,
  endtime: endTime,
  location: event.location || null,
  description: event.description || null,
  attendees: JSON.stringify(event.attendees || []),  // ← ADDED
  meeting_source: 'google',
  is_deleted: false,
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
};
```

## What This Fixes

✅ **New meetings will have attendee data**  
✅ **Client extraction will work automatically**  
✅ **Clients will be created from attendee emails**  
✅ **LinkClientDialog will show existing clients**  
✅ **Action items can be linked to clients**  
✅ **Email-first architecture will work**  

---

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Render deployment** (2-3 minutes)
2. **Hard refresh browser** (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Create a new meeting in Google Calendar**
4. **Check if attendees are captured**:
   - Go to Supabase → meetings table
   - Look at the `attendees` column for the new meeting
   - Should see JSON array with attendee data
5. **Test client extraction**:
   - Run: `POST /api/clients/extract-clients`
   - Should automatically create/link clients from attendees

---

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

```sql
-- Check if new meetings have attendees
SELECT id, title, attendees, created_at 
FROM meetings 
WHERE user_id = '4c903cdf-85ba-4608-8be9-23ec8bbbaa7d'
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- Should see attendees JSON array, not NULL
```

---

## Impact

This was a **critical blocker** for:
- Client management
- Action items
- Email summaries
- Meeting linking

Now that attendees are captured, the entire system should work as designed.
