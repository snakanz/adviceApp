## 🚀 NEW USER EXPERIENCE

### 1. Register Without Calendar ✅
```
User Flow:
1. Go to https://adviceapp.pages.dev/register
2. Sign up with email/Google/Microsoft
3. Complete onboarding (business profile)
4. Skip calendar setup (optional)
5. Access dashboard immediately
6. Connect calendar anytime later

Result: ✅ Users can register without calendar!
```

### 2. Connect Multiple Calendars ✅
```
User Flow:
1. Go to Settings → Calendar Integrations
2. Click "Connect Google Calendar"
3. Authorize with Google
4. Google Calendar is now active
5. Click "Connect Calendly"
6. Authorize with Calendly
7. Calendly becomes active, Google becomes inactive
8. Both tokens stored in database

Result: ✅ Users can have multiple calendars!
```

### 3. Switch Calendars Instantly ✅
```
User Flow:
1. Go to Settings → Calendar Integrations
2. See "Current Connection" (active calendar)
3. See "Available Calendars" (inactive calendars)
4. Click "Switch to Google Calendar"
5. Instant switch (NO re-authentication!)
6. Google becomes active, Calendly becomes inactive
7. Meetings sync from Google

Result: ✅ One-click switching with NO re-auth!
```

### 4. Keep Tokens Stored ✅
```
What Happens:
1. User connects Google Calendar
   → access_token stored in database
   → refresh_token stored in database
   → is_active = true

2. User connects Calendly
   → Google's tokens still in database
   → Calendly's tokens stored in database
   → Google's is_active = false
   → Calendly's is_active = true

3. User switches back to Google
   → Google's tokens retrieved from database
   → NO re-authentication needed
   → Google's is_active = true
   → Calendly's is_active = false

Result: ✅ Tokens persisted and reused!
```

---

## 🎯 WHAT THIS MEANS

### Before (Old Way)
```
❌ Register → Must connect calendar immediately
❌ Can only have ONE calendar
❌ Want to switch? Must re-authenticate
❌ Tokens lost when switching
❌ Frustrating user experience
```

### After (New Way)
```
✅ Register → Calendar optional
✅ Can have MULTIPLE calendars
✅ Switch with ONE CLICK
✅ Tokens persisted and reused
✅ Seamless user experience
```

---

## 🔐 SECURITY MAINTAINED

### User Isolation ✅
```
User A:
- Connects Google Calendar
- Can see ONLY their Google connection
- Cannot see User B's Calendly
- Cannot access User B's tokens

User B:
- Connects Calendly
- Can see ONLY their Calendly connection
- Cannot see User A's Google
- Cannot access User A's tokens

Result: ✅ Complete data isolation!
```

### Multi-Tenant Isolation ✅
```
Each user has:
- Unique user_id (UUID)
- Unique tenant_id (UUID)
- RLS policies enforce isolation
- JWT token verification required

Result: ✅ Users can't see each other's data!
```

## 📊 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Database Schema
```
calendar_connections table:
- id: UUID (primary key)
- user_id: UUID (foreign key to users)
- tenant_id: UUID (nullable, foreign key to tenants)
- provider: TEXT (google, calendly, outlook)
- provider_account_email: TEXT
- access_token: TEXT (encrypted)
- refresh_token: TEXT (encrypted)
- token_expires_at: TIMESTAMP
- is_active: BOOLEAN (only one per user)
- sync_enabled: BOOLEAN
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
- updated_at: TIMESTAMP

Constraint: UNIQUE(user_id, provider, provider_account_email)
Result: Multiple calendars per user!
```

### RLS Policies
```
SELECT: user_id = auth.uid()
INSERT: user_id = auth.uid()
UPDATE: user_id = auth.uid()
DELETE: user_id = auth.uid()

Result: Users can only access their own data!
```
