# âœ… All Fixes Deployed - Ready for Testing

**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Commit**: `36b0e7d`  
**Status**: âœ… Pushed to main - Render deployment in progress

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Fixed

### Fix 1: Google Calendar API Now Returns Attendees âœ…

**Problem**: Google Calendar API wasn't returning attendees data.

**Solution**: Added `fields` parameter to request attendees explicitly.

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/services/calendarSync.js` (line 108)
- `backend/src/services/googleCalendarWebhook.js` (line 259)
- `backend/src/services/calendarDeletionSync.js` (line 98)

**Added**:
```javascript
fields: 'items(id,summary,start,end,location,description,attendees,status)'
```

---

### Fix 2: Action Items Endpoints No Longer Return 500 Errors âœ…

**Problem**: `!inner` joins were causing 500 errors on orphaned records.

**Solution**: Removed `!inner` from 5 locations to allow NULL meetings.

**File**: `backend/src/routes/transcriptActionItems.js`

**Locations Fixed**:
- Line 194: POST /approve endpoint
- Line 350: GET /action-items/by-client endpoint
- Line 464: GET /action-items/by-client (2nd query)
- Line 544: GET /action-items/by-client (3rd query)
- Line 645: GET /pending/all endpoint

**Change**: `meeting:meetings!inner(` â†’ `meeting:meetings(`

---

### Fix 3: Starred Meetings Endpoint Filters Correctly âœ…

**Problem**: Fetching ALL meetings instead of just starred ones.

**Solution**: Added `is_annual_review` filter.

**File**: `backend/src/routes/calendar.js` (line 1598)

**Added**:
```javascript
.eq('is_annual_review', true)
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

### Immediate (After Render deployment - 2-3 minutes)
- âœ… Action items endpoints return 200 OK

## ðŸš€ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Wait for Render Deployment
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select Advicly backend service
3. Check Logs tab
4. Wait for: `âœ… Service deployed successfully`

### Step 2: Test Endpoints
```bash
# Test pending action items
curl -X GET "https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/transcript-action-items/pending/all" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
# Expected: 200 OK with pending items

# Test action items by client
curl -X GET "https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/transcript-action-items/action-items/by-client" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
# Expected: 200 OK with action items

# Test starred meetings
curl -X GET "https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/calendar/meetings/starred" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
# Expected: 200 OK with starred meetings
```

### Step 3: Verify in Frontend
1. Open Advicly platform
2. Go to Action Items page
