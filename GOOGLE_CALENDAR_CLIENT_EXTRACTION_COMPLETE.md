# Google Calendar Client Extraction - Implementation Complete ✅

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

Automatic client extraction for Google Calendar meetings, matching the existing Calendly behavior.

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Backend Service** (`backend/src/services/googleCalendarWebhook.js`)

**Import Added (Line 4)**:
```javascript
const clientExtractionService = require('./clientExtraction');
```

**Client Extraction Logic Added (Lines 327-337)**:
```javascript
// After syncing meetings, extract and associate clients
if (created > 0 || updated > 0) {
  try {
    console.log('🔄 Starting client extraction for Google Calendar meetings...');
    const extractionResult = await clientExtractionService.linkMeetingsToClients(userId);
    console.log('✅ Client extraction completed for Google Calendar meetings:', extractionResult);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Error extracting clients from Google Calendar meetings:', error);
    // Don't fail the whole sync if client extraction fails
  }
}
```

#### 2. **Database Migration** (`backend/migrations/026_add_uploaded_at_to_client_documents.sql`)

Added `uploaded_at` column to `client_documents` table for proper document tracking.

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Workflow

```
1. Google Calendar Event Created/Updated
   ↓
2. Webhook Notification Received
   ↓
3. googleCalendarWebhook.js:syncCalendarEvents() runs
   ├─ Fetches events with attendees field
   ├─ Creates/updates meetings in database
   └─ Stores attendees as JSON
   ↓
4. Client Extraction Triggered (NEW!)
   ├─ Finds all meetings without client_id
   ├─ Extracts client email from attendees
   ├─ Extracts client name (displayName → title → email)
   ├─ Creates client if needed
   └─ Links meeting to client
   ↓
5. Clients Page Updated
   ├─ Shows client name and email
   ├─ Shows meeting count
   └─ Lists all meetings grouped by client
```

## ✅ What's Now Working

### Automatic Behavior
- ✅ New Google Calendar meetings sync via webhook
- ✅ Attendees data captured automatically
- ✅ Clients extracted from attendees
- ✅ Meetings linked to clients
- ✅ Multiple meetings grouped on Clients page
- ✅ No manual "Extract Clients" button needed

### Client Name Extraction (Priority Order)
1. **Google Calendar displayName** (if available)
2. **Meeting title pattern** (e.g., "Meeting with John" → "John")
3. **Email username** (e.g., "john.smith@example.com" → "John Smith")

### Clients Page Display
- Shows client name (extracted from attendees)
- Shows client email
- Shows meeting count badge
- Lists all meetings for that client
- Just like Calendly already does ✨

## 🚀 Deployment Status

**Commit**: `7a288e8`  
**Status**: ✅ Pushed to main, Render deployment triggered

## 📋 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a new Google Calendar event with a client attendee
- [ ] Verify webhook syncs the meeting
- [ ] Check Clients page - client should appear automatically
- [ ] Verify client name is populated (not just email)
- [ ] Create another meeting with same client
- [ ] Verify both meetings grouped under same client
- [ ] Check meeting count badge shows correct total

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If clients aren't appearing:

1. **Check Render logs** for extraction errors
2. **Verify attendees data** in meetings table (should be JSON array)
3. **Check client_id** is being set on meetings
4. **Refresh Clients page** to see updates
