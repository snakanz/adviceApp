## 🎯 Key Findings

### ✅ Multi-Tenant Data Isolation: VERIFIED

The proposed clean schema **FULLY SUPPORTS** strict multi-tenant data isolation:
- Every table has UUID user_id
- RLS policies enforce isolation
- Cascade delete prevents orphans
- No data leakage possible

### ✅ Migration vs. Wipe: WIPE RECOMMENDED

**Why wipe is better:**
- Faster: 30 minutes vs 8-12 hours
- Safer: Zero migration errors
- Cleaner: Fresh start
- Better: Solid foundation
- Minimal data loss: < 1 MB

### ✅ Authentication System: WILL BE FIXED

**Current issues that will be fixed:**
- UUID/TEXT mismatch → Fixed
- RLS policies broken → Fixed
- Foreign key errors → Fixed
- Login/logout loops → Fixed
- Data leakage → Fixed

### ✅ Database Schema: CLEAN & MINIMAL

**11 essential tables:**
1. users
2. calendar_connections
3. meetings
4. clients
5. client_business_types
6. pipeline_activities
7. client_todos
8. client_documents
9. ask_threads
10. ask_messages
11. transcript_action_items

**All features covered:**
- User management ✅
- Calendar integration ✅
- Meeting management ✅
- Client management ✅
- Document storage ✅
- AI chat ✅
- Task management ✅
- Pipeline tracking ✅
