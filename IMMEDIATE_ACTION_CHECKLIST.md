# ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTION CHECKLIST

**Status:** Code deployed ‚úÖ  
**Next:** Complete these 3 steps to finish

---

## üéØ STEP 1: Run Database Migration (2 minutes)

### Action:
1. Open https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your **Advicly** project
3. Click **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Click **New Query** (blue button)
5. Open file: `RUN_THIS_IN_SUPABASE.sql`
6. Copy ALL the code
7. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
8. Click **Run** (blue button)
9. Wait for success message ‚úÖ

### Expected Output:
```
Query executed successfully
```

### Verification:
After running, you should see:
- ‚úÖ `payload` column added to `recall_webhook_events`
- ‚úÖ Index created on `event_type`
- ‚úÖ No errors

---

## ‚è≥ STEP 2: Wait for Render Deployment (3 minutes)

### Action:
1. Open https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select your **Advicly** backend service
3. Click **Logs** tab
4. Wait for deployment to complete
5. Look for this message:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Recall V2 routes mounted successfully
   ```

### What to Expect:
- Render will auto-deploy your code changes
- Takes 2-3 minutes
- You'll see deployment progress in logs

### If You See Errors:
- Check `RECALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Environment
- Check `RECALL_API_KEY` in Environment
- Both should be set

---

## üß™ STEP 3: Verify Everything Works (5 minutes)

### Action 1: Check Webhook Events
In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
```sql
SELECT 
  webhook_id,
  bot_id,
  event_type,
  status,
  created_at
FROM recall_webhook_events 
WHERE bot_id = '1135ddc6-6116-490b-a88e-1f2e2e737c23'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected:** You should see webhook events from your test meeting

### Action 2: Check Meeting Transcript
In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  recall_status,
  transcript_source,
  CASE WHEN transcript IS NOT NULL THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END as has_transcript,
  CASE WHEN quick_summary IS NOT NULL THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END as has_summary
FROM meetings 
WHERE recall_bot_id = '1135ddc6-6116-490b-a88e-1f2e2e737c23';
```

**Expected:**
- `recall_status` = `'completed'`
- `transcript_source` = `'recall'`
- `has_transcript` = `'Yes'`
- `has_summary` = `'Yes'` (if AI processing completed)

### Action 3: Check Render Logs
In Render logs, search for:
```
üì• Received Recall webhook: transcript.done
‚úÖ Transcript retrieved
‚úÖ Transcript stored for meeting
```

**Expected:** You should see these messages

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CHECKLIST

- [ ] Database migration ran successfully
- [ ] Render logs show "Recall V2 routes mounted successfully"
- [ ] Webhook events appear in `recall_webhook_events` table
- [ ] Meeting has transcript in database
- [ ] Meeting has quick_summary in database
- [ ] Render logs show webhook processing messages

---

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### ‚ùå Database migration failed
**Solution:**
1. Check you're in the correct Supabase project
2. Check you have permission to modify tables
3. Try running the migration again
4. Check for error messages in the output

### ‚ùå Render deployment failed
**Solution:**
1. Check `RECALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set
2. Check `RECALL_API_KEY` is set
3. Check Render logs for error messages
4. Try redeploying manually

### ‚ùå No webhook events in database
**Solution:**
1. Check Recall.ai dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Activity
2. Look for your endpoint URL
3. Check error rate (should be 0%)
4. If errors, click on failed event to see error message

### ‚ùå Transcript not appearing
**Solution:**
1. Check if `transcript.done` webhook was received
2. Check Render logs for "Fetching transcript from Recall"
3. If error, check API key is correct
4. Verify bot has `recording_id` in Recall.ai dashboard

---

## üìû NEED HELP?

1. **Check the logs** - Render logs are very detailed
2. **Run verification queries** - See what's in the database
3. **Check Recall.ai dashboard** - See webhook activity
4. **Review documentation** - See files listed below

---

## üìö DOCUMENTATION FILES

- `RECALL_WEBHOOK_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Full overview
- `RECALL_WEBHOOK_FIXES_APPLIED.md` - Detailed explanation of fixes
- `RECALL_WEBHOOK_NEXT_STEPS.md` - Step-by-step testing guide
- `RECALL_WEBHOOK_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - Technical summary
- `RUN_THIS_IN_SUPABASE.sql` - Database migration SQL

---

## üéâ WHAT'S NEXT

Once everything is verified:

1. **Test with a new meeting** to verify end-to-end flow
2. **Monitor webhook events** for 24 hours
3. **Check error logs** for any issues
4. **Verify frontend** displays transcripts and summaries
