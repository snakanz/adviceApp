# Backend Health Check

## Quick Test

Once the backend deploys, you can test if it's working by visiting:

```
https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "database": "connected",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T22:45:00.000Z"
}
```

**If you see this, the backend is working! ✅**

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment is taking more than 10 minutes:

1. **Check Render Status:** https://status.render.com
2. **Cancel and retry:** In Render dashboard, click "Cancel Deploy" then "Manual Deploy"
3. **Check for errors:** Look at the "Logs" tab for any error messages

### If deployment succeeds but backend doesn't respond:

1. **Check environment variables:** Make sure all required env vars are set in Render
2. **Check logs for errors:** Look for any runtime errors after "Backend running on port 8787"
3. **Test health endpoint:** Visit `/api/health` to see if server responds

### If you still see path-to-regexp error:

This means the fix didn't work. Possible causes:
1. Git commit didn't include the changes
2. Render deployed an older commit
3. There's another `app.options('*')` somewhere else

**Solution:** Check which commit Render deployed and verify it's `d401a81` or later.

---

## Expected Timeline

**Normal deployment:**
- 0-2 min: Cloning repository
- 2-5 min: Installing dependencies (`npm install`)
- 5-6 min: Starting server (`node src/index.js`)
- **Total: 5-7 minutes**

**If it takes longer:**
- 7-10 min: Might be slow network or Render is busy
- 10+ min: Likely stuck - cancel and retry

---

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. ✅ Visit `/api/health` to confirm backend is running
2. ✅ Test creating a pipeline entry from Clients page
3. ✅ Verify data appears on Pipeline page with correct IAF Expected
4. ✅ Fix David and Marion Wright by creating their pipeline entry
