## 🚀 Deployment Status

### **Automatic Deployment**

Render automatically deploys when you push to main:

1. ✅ Code committed to git
2. ✅ Pushed to origin/main
3. ⏳ Render webhook triggered (automatic)
4. ⏳ Backend building (2-5 minutes)
5. ⏳ Backend deploying (1-2 minutes)
6. ⏳ Backend live (total 3-7 minutes)

### **Check Deployment Status**

```
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select: Advicly backend service
3. Click: "Events" tab
4. Look for: Latest deployment
5. Status should show: "Live" (green)
```

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### **Step 1: Wait for Deployment (5 minutes)**

Wait for Render to deploy the backend. You'll see:
- Status changes from "Building" → "Deploying" → "Live"
- Green checkmark next to service name

### **Step 2: Test Calendar Connection**

```
1. Go to: https://adviceapp.pages.dev
2. Log in with Google (use snaka1003@gmail.com)
3. Go to: Settings → Calendar Integrations

5. Complete OAuth flow
6. Wait for sync (5-10 seconds)
```

### **Expected Results**

✅ **Success Indicators:**

- Meetings appear on Meetings page
- No errors in Render logs

❌ **Error Indicators:**

- 500 Internal Server Error
- Calendar connection fails
- Meetings don't appear

### **Step 3: Verify No Errors**

**Check Browser Console:**
```

2. Go to: Console tab
3. Look for: Red error messages
4. Should see: No errors
```
