## üóÑÔ∏è Database Migration Testing

### Pre-Migration Checks
- [ ] Backup current database
- [ ] Verify users table has UUID id column
- [ ] Check existing user count
- [ ] Check existing meetings count
- [ ] Check existing clients count

### Migration Execution
- [ ] Run `020_multi_tenant_onboarding.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Verify success messages in output
- [ ] Check all tables created: `tenants`, `tenant_members`, `calendar_connections`
- [ ] Verify `tenant_id` columns added to all tables
- [ ] Check RLS policies created

### Data Migration (if applicable)
- [ ] Run `021_migrate_existing_data.sql`
- [ ] Verify tenants created for all existing users
- [ ] Check all users have `tenant_id` set
- [ ] Verify all meetings have `tenant_id` set
- [ ] Verify all clients have `tenant_id` set
- [ ] Check calendar tokens migrated to `calendar_connections`

### Post-Migration Verification
```sql
-- Run these queries to verify:

-- 1. Check tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN ('tenants', 'tenant_members', 'calendar_connections');
-- Expected: 3 rows

-- 2. Check tenant_id columns
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE column_name = 'tenant_id' ORDER BY table_name;
-- Expected: Multiple rows

-- 3. Check RLS policies
SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('tenants', 'tenant_members', 'calendar_connections');
-- Expected: Multiple policies

-- 4. Verify data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) as tenant_count FROM tenants;
SELECT COUNT(*) as users_with_tenant FROM users WHERE tenant_id IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) as users_without_tenant FROM users WHERE tenant_id IS NULL;
-- Expected: users_without_tenant = 0
```

## üîß Backend API Testing

### Tenant Management Endpoints

**GET /api/tenants/my-tenant**

  -d '{"name":"Test Business","business_type":"Financial Advisor","team_size":1}' \
  http://localhost:3001/api/tenants
```
- [ ] Creates new tenant
- [ ] Returns tenant data
- [ ] Adds user as owner in tenant_members
- [ ] Updates user's tenant_id
- [ ] Returns 400 if user already has tenant

### Onboarding Endpoints

**GET /api/auth/onboarding/status**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/auth/onboarding/status
```
- [ ] Returns onboarding status
- [ ] Shows current step
- [ ] Shows completion status

**POST /api/auth/onboarding/business-profile**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"business_name":"Test Co","business_type":"Financial Advisor","team_size":1}' \
  http://localhost:3001/api/auth/onboarding/business-profile
```
- [ ] Saves business profile
- [ ] Creates tenant if doesn't exist
- [ ] Updates onboarding_step to 2
- [ ] Returns tenant_id

**POST /api/auth/onboarding/complete**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/auth/onboarding/complete
```
- [ ] Marks onboarding as complete
- [ ] Sets onboarding_completed to true
- [ ] Sets onboarding_step to 6

-- Test as a specific user
SET request.jwt.claims.sub = 'user-uuid-here';

-- Try to access another tenant's data
SELECT * FROM tenants WHERE owner_id != 'user-uuid-here';
-- Expected: No rows (RLS blocks access)

-- Try to access own tenant
SELECT * FROM tenants WHERE owner_id = 'user-uuid-here';
-- Expected: User's tenant data
```
