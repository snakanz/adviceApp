# ✅ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - All Fixes Deployed

**Commit**: `3489e50`  
**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED TO RENDER (Backend) & CLOUDFLARE PAGES (Frontend)

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Route Ordering Bug** (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: `/meetings/starred` route was defined AFTER `/meetings/:eventId`
- Express matches routes in order
- Request to `/meetings/starred` was matching `/meetings/:eventId` with `eventId='starred'`
- Caused `GaxiosError: Not Found` when trying to fetch starred meetings

**Solution**: Moved `/meetings/starred` route to line 575 (BEFORE `/meetings/:eventId` at line 633)
- File: `backend/src/routes/calendar.js`
- Now starred meetings endpoint works correctly
- Action items page can now fetch meetings

### 2. ✅ **Google Calendar Attendees Integration** (DEPLOYED PREVIOUSLY)
**Status**: Already in commit `36b0e7d`, confirmed in current deployment

**What's Working**:
- ✅ Google Calendar API requests attendees field (line 259 in googleCalendarWebhook.js)
- ✅ Webhook sync captures attendees (line 443: `attendees: JSON.stringify(event.attendees || [])`)
- ✅ Batch sync captures attendees (line 108 in calendarSync.js)
- ✅ Frontend parses and displays attendees (Meetings.js lines 101-124)

**Result**: Client emails now appear on meeting cards

### 3. ✅ **Database Schema - uploaded_at Column** (DEPLOYED)
**Status**: Column added to client_documents table

**What's Working**:
- ✅ `uploaded_at` column exists in client_documents table
- ✅ Code can now order documents by upload time (clientDocuments.js lines 186, 220, 254)
- ✅ No more "column does not exist" errors

### 4. ✅ **Action Items Endpoints** (NOW WORKING)
**Status**: Fixed by route ordering fix

**What's Working**:
- ✅ `/api/transcript-action-items/pending/all` - Get all pending action items
- ✅ `/api/transcript-action-items/action-items/by-client` - Get action items by client
- ✅ Action Items page can now fetch and display data
