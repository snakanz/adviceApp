# ‚úÖ Centralized Pending Action Items Approval - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Issue:**
Advisors with multiple meetings in a day need to open each meeting individually to review and approve AI-extracted action items. For example, an advisor with 5 meetings and 5 action items each (25 total pending items) would need to:
- Open Meeting 1 ‚Üí Review 5 items ‚Üí Approve/Reject
- Open Meeting 2 ‚Üí Review 5 items ‚Üí Approve/Reject
- Open Meeting 3 ‚Üí Review 5 items ‚Üí Approve/Reject
- Open Meeting 4 ‚Üí Review 5 items ‚Üí Approve/Reject
- Open Meeting 5 ‚Üí Review 5 items ‚Üí Approve/Reject

This is inefficient and time-consuming.

**Solution:**
Created a centralized "Pending Approval" tab on the Action Items page where advisors can review and approve ALL pending action items from ALL meetings in one place with bulk operations.

## üöÄ What Was Built

### **Backend Changes**

#### **New API Endpoint:**
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/transcript-action-items/pending/all`
- **Purpose:** Fetch all pending action items across all meetings for the advisor
- **Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "clients": [
    {
      "clientId": "uuid",
      "clientName": "John Doe",
      "clientEmail": "john@example.com",
      "meetings": [
        {
          "meetingId": 123,
          "meetingTitle": "Financial Planning Meeting",
          "meetingStartTime": "2025-10-15T10:00:00Z",
          "googleEventId": "abc123",
          "pendingItems": [
            {
              "id": "uuid",
              "actionText": "Send updated Suitability Letter via DocuSign",
              "displayOrder": 0,
              "createdAt": "2025-10-15T11:00:00Z"
            }
