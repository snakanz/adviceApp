# 🚀 Calendly Real-Time Sync - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ **Everything is Already Set Up!**

Your Advicly app is **already configured** for real-time Calendly sync. No code changes needed!

---

## 📋 **What You Need to Do Now**

### **1. Test the Webhook (2 minutes)**

**Book a test meeting in Calendly:**
1. Go to your Calendly booking page
2. Schedule a test meeting for tomorrow
3. Complete the booking

**Check if it worked:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select **adviceapp-9rgw**
3. Click **"Logs"** tab
4. Look for these messages:
   ```
   📥 Received Calendly webhook: { event: 'invitee.created', ... }
   ⚠️  CALENDLY_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY not configured - skipping signature verification
   ✅ Meeting created from webhook: [Meeting Title]
   ```
5. Open your Advicly app
6. Check if the meeting appears **within 1-2 seconds**

**✅ If you see the logs and the meeting appears → Webhook is working!**

---

### **2. Clean Up Stale Meetings (5 minutes)**

You mentioned meetings have been changed. Here's how to fix that:

#### **Option A: Run Full Sync (Easiest)**

**Via Advicly App:**
1. Log into Advicly
2. Go to Settings or Meetings page
3. Click **"Sync Calendly"** button
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for sync to complete

**Via Command Line:**
```bash
# You'll need your JWT token from the browser
# Open browser console and run: localStorage.getItem('token')

curl -X POST https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/calendly/sync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

This will:
- ✅ Update all changed meetings
- ✅ Mark canceled meetings as deleted
- ✅ Add any missing meetings
- ✅ Remove duplicates

#### **Option B: Run Database Cleanup (Advanced)**

If you have many duplicates or stale data:

1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Open your project: **xjqjzievgepqpgtggcjx**
3. Click **"SQL Editor"**
4. Open the file: `cleanup-calendly-meetings.sql`
5. Copy and paste the SQL
6. Click **"Run"**

This will:
- ✅ Remove duplicate meetings
- ✅ Archive old meetings (optional)
- ✅ Show detailed statistics
- ✅ Identify meetings needing sync

---

### **3. Monitor for 24 Hours (Passive)**

Just let it run and check periodically:

**What to check:**
- ✅ Render logs show automatic sync every 15 minutes
- ✅ New bookings appear instantly via webhook
- ✅ Canceled meetings are removed
- ✅ No errors in logs

**Where to check:**
- Render logs: https://dashboard.render.com → adviceapp-9rgw → Logs
- Advicly app: Check meetings page
- Supabase: Check `meetings` table

---

## 📊 **What's Already Working**

### ✅ **Webhook Handler**
- **Location**: `backend/src/routes/calendly.js`
- **Status**: Active and listening
- **Events**: `invitee.created`, `invitee.canceled`
- **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate processing
- **Speed**: 1-2 seconds

### ✅ **Automatic Scheduler**
- **Location**: `backend/src/services/syncScheduler.js`
- **Status**: Running automatically
- **Frequency**: Every 15 minutes
- **Type**: Incremental sync (3 months back, 6 months forward)
- **Startup**: Starts 5 seconds after server boot

### ✅ **Sync Service**
- **Location**: `backend/src/services/calendlyService.js`
- **Features**:
  - Full and incremental sync
  - Handles active and canceled events
  - Updates existing meetings
  - Marks deleted meetings
  - Restores re-scheduled meetings
  - Extracts and links clients automatically

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Webhook Not Firing**

**Check webhook status:**
```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.calendly.com/webhook_subscriptions/af8074d8-7d56-4431-b2b8-653f64c3f5b4' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CALENDLY_TOKEN'
```

**Look for:**
- `"state": "active"` ✅
- `"callback_url": "https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/calendly/webhook"` ✅

### **Meetings Not Syncing**

**Check scheduler:**
```bash
curl https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/calendly/scheduler/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

**Look for:**
- `"isRunning": true` ✅
- `"calendlyConfigured": true` ✅

**Trigger manual sync:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/calendly/scheduler/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### **Duplicate Meetings**

**Run cleanup script:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run `cleanup-calendly-meetings.sql`
3. Check results

**Or run full sync:**
- Click "Sync Calendly" in app
- This will deduplicate automatically

### **Stale/Changed Meetings**

**Solution:**
- Run a full sync (click "Sync Calendly" in app)
- Wait for automatic sync to catch up (within 15 minutes)
- Check Render logs for sync activity
