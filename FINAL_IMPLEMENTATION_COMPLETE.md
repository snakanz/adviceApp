## ⚠️ REQUIRED: Run Database Migration

Before you can use the action items priority features, you **must** run the database migration:

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your Advicly project

2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Copy and Paste This SQL:**

```sql
-- Add Priority Column to Action Items
ALTER TABLE transcript_action_items 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS priority INTEGER DEFAULT 3 CHECK (priority BETWEEN 1 AND 4);

-- Add comment for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN transcript_action_items.priority IS 'AI-assigned priority level: 1=Urgent, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low';

-- Create index for faster filtering by priority
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_transcript_action_items_priority ON transcript_action_items(priority);
```

4. **Click "Run"**

5. **Verify Success**
   - You should see "Success. No rows returned"
   - The migration is complete!
