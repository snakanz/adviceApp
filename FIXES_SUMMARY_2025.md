# Advicly Platform Fixes - Summary

## Date: 2025-10-15

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Scroll Behavior on Clients and Pipeline Pages ✅

**Problem:**
- Clients page detail panel was not scrollable
- Pipeline page scroll issues

**Solution:**
- Added `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` to Clients page detail panel content div (line 860)
- Pipeline page already had correct structure with `flex-1 overflow-auto`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Clients.js`

---

### 2. Email Template AI Prompt Update ✅

**Problem:**
- Current "Advicly Summary" template was generating emails with incorrect layouts
- User wanted a new structured format with Key Discussion Points and Next Steps sections

**Solution:**
- Updated the AI prompt template to new format across all locations:
  - Frontend template definition
  - Backend auto-generation endpoints (2 locations)
  - Backend calendar route

**New Template Format:**
```
Role: Professional financial advisor's assistant (Nelson Greenwood)
Goal: Generate clear, well-structured email with key financial advice and numerical details

Sections:
- Warm conversational opening
- Key Discussion Points (bolded headings with bullet points)
- Next Steps (numbered action items with timelines)
- Professional closing
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Templates.js`
- `backend/src/index.js` (2 locations)
- `backend/src/routes/calendar.js`

### 3. Comprehensive Action Items / To-Do List Feature ⚡

**Problem:**
- User uploaded transcript for Samantha Jones meeting
- Needed action items extracted from transcripts
- Required checkbox-based to-do lists across three pages:
  - Meeting Detail Page
  - Client Meeting History
  - Action Items Page (grouped by client)

**Solution Implemented:**

#### A. Database Schema
- Created `transcript_action_items` table with columns:
  - `id` (UUID)
  - `meeting_id` (references meetings)
  - `client_id` (references clients)
  - `advisor_id` (references users)
  - `action_text` (TEXT)
  - `completed` (BOOLEAN)
  - `completed_at` (TIMESTAMP)
  - `display_order` (INTEGER)
  - Proper indexes and triggers

**Migration File:** `backend/migrations/012_transcript_action_items.sql`

#### B. Backend AI Integration
- Updated action points generation prompt to output JSON array format
- Backend parses JSON response and extracts individual action items
- Automatically saves each action item to database with proper relationships
- Fallback to plain text parsing if JSON parsing fails

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/routes/calendar.js` (auto-generate summaries endpoint)
- `backend/src/index.js` (transcript upload endpoint)

#### C. API Endpoints
Created new route file: `backend/src/routes/transcriptActionItems.js`

Endpoints:
- `GET /api/transcript-action-items/meetings/:meetingId/action-items` - Get action items for a meeting
- `PATCH /api/transcript-action-items/action-items/:actionItemId/toggle` - Toggle completion status
- `GET /api/transcript-action-items/action-items/by-client` - Get all action items grouped by client
- `GET /api/transcript-action-items/clients/:clientId/action-items` - Get action items for a client

#### D. Frontend Implementation

**Meetings Page (COMPLETE ✅):**
- Added state for action items and loading status
- Created `fetchActionItems()` function to load action items for selected meeting
- Created `toggleActionItem()` function to mark items complete/incomplete
- Replaced plain text action points display with checkbox-based to-do list
- Visual feedback: completed items show strikethrough and completion date
- Real-time updates when toggling completion status

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Meetings.js`

**Clients Page (PENDING ⏳):**
- Need to fetch action items for client
- Display action items summary in each meeting card in Meeting History section
- Show count of pending action items per meeting

**Action Items Page (PENDING ⏳):**
- Need to update to use new transcript action items API
- Group action items by client
- Show meeting context for each action item
- Allow filtering by completion status

## Database Migration Required

Run this migration in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- File: backend/migrations/012_transcript_action_items.sql
-- (See file for full migration)
```

---

## Deployment Notes

1. **Backend Deployment:**
   - New migration file needs to be run in Supabase
   - New route file added: `backend/src/routes/transcriptActionItems.js`
   - Updated files: `backend/src/index.js`, `backend/src/routes/calendar.js`

2. **Frontend Deployment:**
   - Updated files: `src/pages/Meetings.js`, `src/pages/Clients.js`, `src/pages/Templates.js`
   - No new dependencies required

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - No new environment variables required
   - Existing OpenAI API key is used for action items extraction

---

## Known Limitations

1. Action items extraction depends on OpenAI API availability
2. If JSON parsing fails, falls back to plain text parsing (may not create individual checkable items)
3. Clients page and Action Items page updates are pending

---

## Next Steps

1. Complete Clients page action items display
2. Complete Action Items page grouped view
3. Consider adding:
   - Due dates for action items
   - Priority levels
   - Assignment to specific team members
   - Email notifications for pending action items
