# Quick Fix: Meetings Not Showing

## üö® The Issue

Meetings are not appearing in the Meetings page, even though Google Calendar is connected.

## ‚ö° Quick Fixes (Try These First)

### Fix #1: Refresh Your Login (Most Common)
**This fixes 80% of cases!**

1. **Log out** of Advicly
   - Click your profile icon
   - Click "Log out"

2. **Log back in** with Google
   - Click "Sign in with Google"
   - Complete OAuth flow

3. **Wait 10-15 seconds** for initial sync

4. **Go to Meetings page**
   - Meetings should now appear

**Why this works:** Your JWT token expired. Logging back in creates a new token and triggers the initial sync.

### Fix #2: Reconnect Google Calendar
**If Fix #1 doesn't work:**

1. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Calendar Integrations**

2. **Click "Disconnect"**
   - This stops the old webhook

3. **Click "Connect Google Calendar"**
   - Complete OAuth flow

4. **Wait 10-15 seconds** for initial sync
   - Watch for "Last sync" to update

5. **Go to Meetings page**
   - Meetings should now appear

**Why this works:** Reconnecting triggers the initial sync to fetch all existing meetings.

### Fix #3: Check Your Connection Status
**Verify the connection is working:**

1. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Calendar Integrations**

2. **Look for "Current Connection" section**
   - Should show "Google Calendar" with green checkmark
   - Should show "Connected" status
   - Should show "Sync enabled" (green)

3. **Check "Last sync" timestamp**
   - Should show a recent time (not "Never")
   - If "Never", try Fix #2

4. **If still "Never":**
   - Check backend logs on Render
   - Look for "Setting up Google Calendar watch" message
   - Look for "Initial sync completed" message

## üîç Verify It's Working

### Test 1: Check Settings
- ‚úÖ Google Calendar shows "Connected"
- ‚úÖ "Last sync" shows recent time
- ‚úÖ "Sync enabled" is green

### Test 2: Create a Test Meeting
1. Open Google Calendar in another tab
2. Create a new meeting
3. Go back to Advicly Meetings page
4. Wait 5 seconds
5. Refresh the page
6. New meeting should appear

### Test 3: Check Database (Advanced)
If meetings still don't appear, check the database:

```sql
-- Go to Supabase SQL Editor and run:
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_meetings
FROM meetings
WHERE userid = '4c903cdf-85ba-4608-8be9-23ec8bbbaa7d';
```

If this returns 0, no meetings are in the database.

## üÜò If Nothing Works

### Step 1: Check Backend Logs
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Select your backend service
3. Go to "Logs"
4. Look for these messages:
   - "Setting up Google Calendar watch" ‚úÖ Good
   - "Initial sync completed" ‚úÖ Good
   - "Webhook setup failed" ‚ùå Problem
   - "Token expired" ‚ùå Problem

### Step 2: Check Database Migration
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run this query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM calendar_watch_channels LIMIT 1;
```

3. If you get an error "table does not exist":
   - Run migration: `backend/migrations/025_update_calendar_watch_channels_for_uuid.sql`
   - Then reconnect Google Calendar

### Step 3: Verify Google Calendar Connection
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Calendar Integrations
2. Check the account email shown
3. Verify it's the correct Google account
4. If wrong account, disconnect and reconnect with correct account
