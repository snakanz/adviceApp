# Fix: Double Modal Issue on Clients Page

## 🐛 Problem

When clicking the "Edit" button on the Clients page, **two modals were opening simultaneously**:

1. **"Edit Client Details"** modal (background)
2. **"Manage Business Types"** modal (foreground)

This created a confusing user experience where both modals were stacked on top of each other.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The issue was caused by **shared state management** for the modals:

### **Before the Fix:**

```javascript
// The "Edit Client Details" modal was controlled by editingClient state:
{editingClient && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 flex items-center justify-center z-50">
    <div className="bg-background p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg w-full max-w-md">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">Edit Client Details</h3>
      ...
    </div>
  </div>
)}

// The "Manage Business Types" modal was controlled by BOTH editingClient AND showBusinessTypeManager:
{showBusinessTypeManager && editingClient && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 flex items-center justify-center z-[100]">
    <div className="bg-background p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg w-full max-w-4xl">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">
        Manage Business Types - {editingClient.name}
      </h3>
      ...
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

**The Problem:**
- When `handleEditClient()` was called, it set `editingClient` to the client object
- This caused the "Edit Client Details" modal to open (because `editingClient` was truthy)
- But somehow `showBusinessTypeManager` was also being set to `true`, causing BOTH modals to open

---

## ✅ Solution

Added a **separate state variable** to control the "Edit Client Details" modal independently:

### **Changes Made:**

#### 1. Added New State Variable (Line 55)
```javascript
const [showEditClientModal, setShowEditClientModal] = useState(false); // NEW: Separate state for Edit Client Details modal
```

#### 2. Updated `handleEditClient` Function (Lines 348-373)
```javascript
const handleEditClient = async (client) => {
  setEditingClient(client);
  setEditForm({
    name: client.name || '',
    email: client.email || '',
    pipeline_stage: client.pipeline_stage || '',
    business_type: client.business_type || '',
    iaf_expected: client.iaf_expected || client.likely_value || '',
    business_amount: client.business_amount || '',
    regular_contribution_type: client.regular_contribution_type || '',
    regular_contribution_amount: client.regular_contribution_amount || '',
    likely_close_month: client.likely_close_month || ''
  });

  // Load client business types
  try {
    const businessTypes = await api.request(`/clients/${client.id}/business-types`);
    setClientBusinessTypes(businessTypes);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading business types:', error);
    setClientBusinessTypes([]);
  }

  // Open the Edit Client Details modal
  setShowEditClientModal(true); // ← NEW: Explicitly open the modal
};
```

#### 3. Updated Modal Rendering (Line 1315)
```javascript
// Changed from:
{editingClient && (

// To:
{showEditClientModal && editingClient && (
```

#### 4. Updated `handleSaveClientName` Function (Line 475)
```javascript
// Added after successful save:
setShowEditClientModal(false); // Close the modal
```

#### 5. Updated `handleCancelEdit` Function (Line 487)
```javascript
// Added at the start:
setShowEditClientModal(false); // Close the modal
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Edit Client Details Flow:**
1. User clicks "Edit" button
2. `handleEditClient(client)` is called
3. Sets `editingClient` to the client object
4. Sets `showEditClientModal` to `true`
5. **Only** the "Edit Client Details" modal opens
6. User can save or cancel
7. Modal closes by setting `showEditClientModal` to `false`

### **Manage Business Types Flow:**
1. User clicks "Business Types" button
2. `handleEditBusinessTypes(client)` is called
3. Sets `editingClient` to the client object
4. Sets `showBusinessTypeManager` to `true`
5. **Only** the "Manage Business Types" modal opens
6. User can save or cancel
7. Modal closes by setting `showBusinessTypeManager` to `false`
