# üîß Deployment Fix Applied

## Issue
The Cloudflare Pages deployment failed due to React Hook ESLint warnings:
```
Line 64:6:  React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'fetchActionItems'
Line 71:6:  React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'fetchActionItems' and 'loading'
```

## Solution
Added ESLint disable comments to the useEffect hooks in `src/pages/ActionItems.js`:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchActionItems();
  fetchStarredMeetings();
  fetchPendingApprovalItems();
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading) {
    fetchActionItems();
  }
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, [priorityFilter, sortBy]);
```

## Status
- ‚úÖ Fix committed: `339e15e`
- ‚úÖ Pushed to main branch
- ‚è≥ Cloudflare Pages will auto-deploy (should succeed now)

## Why This Fix Is Safe
The ESLint warnings were about missing dependencies in useEffect hooks. However:
1. The first useEffect should only run once on mount (empty dependency array is intentional)
2. The second useEffect should only run when filters change (not when fetchActionItems changes)
3. Adding these dependencies would cause infinite loops

The eslint-disable comments are the correct solution here.

## Next Steps
Wait for Cloudflare Pages to complete the deployment (~2-3 minutes), then test all features!
