# Advicly AI Enhancement Project - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Project Lead:** Simon Greenwood  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Analysis Complete - Ready for Implementation

---

## üéØ Project Overview

Transform Advicly's AI functionality into a powerful, ChatGPT Desktop-like document analysis and client intelligence system with:

1. **Bulk document upload & AI analysis** - Automatically extract insights from PDFs, images, and transcripts
2. **Intelligent document association** - Auto-detect which client documents relate to based on content
3. **Client-specific AI assistant** - Mini-LLM for each client with full context awareness
4. **Performance improvements** - Fix lag, add streaming responses, optimize context loading
5. **UI/UX enhancements** - Fix responsive design issues and improve user experience

---

## üìä Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working

- **Solid OpenAI Integration:** Using GPT-4 for chat, GPT-4o-mini for summaries
- **Persistent Conversations:** ask_threads and ask_messages tables working well
- **Meeting Documents:** Upload system functional for meeting-level files
- **Context-Aware Chat:** Basic client and meeting context in AI responses
- **Action Item Extraction:** AI successfully extracts and prioritizes action items

### ‚ùå Critical Issues Identified

1. **No Document Analysis** - Files uploaded but never analyzed by AI
2. **No Client-Level Documents** - Can only attach files to meetings, not clients
3. **No Auto-Detection** - Manual client selection required for every upload
4. **AI Response Lag** - 5-15 second wait with no feedback (no streaming)
5. **Limited Context** - AI missing business types, pipeline data, documents
6. **UI Overflow Bug** - "Needs Attention" section breaks on small screens
7. **Inefficient Queries** - Loading all meetings/transcripts every time
8. **No Caching** - Repeated queries waste tokens and time
9. **No Token Tracking** - Can't monitor costs or usage
10. **Poor Error Handling** - Single API failure breaks features
