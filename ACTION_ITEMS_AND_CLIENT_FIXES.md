# Action Items Page & Edit Client Modal Fixes

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Starred Meetings Endpoint** (`GET /api/calendar/meetings/starred`)
**Problem**: 
- Filtering by `is_annual_review` column that doesn't exist
- Trying to use client relationship that was causing PGRST200 errors

**Solution**:
- ✅ Changed filter from `is_annual_review = true` to `transcript IS NOT NULL`
- ✅ Removed problematic `client:clients()` relationship query
- ✅ Now returns all meetings with transcripts (starred meetings)
- ✅ Returns only `clientId` instead of full client object

**File**: `backend/src/routes/calendar.js` (lines 573-623)

---

### 2. **Pending Action Items Endpoint** (`GET /api/transcript-action-items/pending/all`)
**Problem**:
- Trying to use `client:clients()` relationship that doesn't exist
- Supabase couldn't find FK relationship between tables

**Solution**:
- ✅ Removed relationship query
- ✅ Fetch meetings and clients separately using `.in()` queries
- ✅ Build maps to associate data without relationships
- ✅ Maintain grouping by client functionality

**File**: `backend/src/routes/transcriptActionItems.js` (lines 640-720)

---

### 3. **Action Items by Client Endpoint** (`GET /api/transcript-action-items/action-items/by-client`)
**Problem**:
- Same relationship query issues as pending items
- PGRST200 errors when trying to fetch related data

**Solution**:
- ✅ Removed `meeting:meetings()` and `client:clients()` relationships
- ✅ Fetch meetings and clients separately
- ✅ Build maps for data association
- ✅ Maintain grouping and sorting functionality

**File**: `backend/src/routes/transcriptActionItems.js` (lines 345-437)

---

### 4. **Edit Client Modal** - Show Saved Data
**Problem**:
- After saving client details, modal didn't show updated data
- Modal was using stale client object from initial fetch

**Solution**:
- ✅ Fetch fresh client data when opening modal
- ✅ Use `/clients/{id}` endpoint to get latest values
- ✅ Fallback to passed client if fetch fails
- ✅ Modal now always shows current saved data

**File**: `src/pages/Clients.js` (lines 358-384)

## 📊 Technical Details

### Why These Fixes Work

**Problem**: Supabase relationship queries (e.g., `client:clients()`) require:
1. Foreign key constraint to exist
2. Relationship to be properly defined in schema
3. No orphaned records

**Solution**: Fetch data separately using `.in()` queries:
```javascript
// Instead of:
.select('*, client:clients(...)')

// We now do:
.select('*')
// Then fetch clients separately:
.in('id', clientIds)
// And build maps to associate data
```

This approach:
- ✅ Avoids FK relationship issues
- ✅ Handles orphaned records gracefully
- ✅ Provides better error handling
- ✅ More explicit data flow

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **backend/src/routes/calendar.js**
   - Updated starred meetings endpoint

2. **backend/src/routes/transcriptActionItems.js**
   - Updated pending/all endpoint
   - Updated action-items/by-client endpoint

3. **src/pages/Clients.js**

## ✨ Summary

All Action Items page endpoints now work without relying on Supabase relationship queries. The Edit Client modal now shows saved data correctly by fetching fresh data when opened.

**Status**: Ready for testing! 🎉
