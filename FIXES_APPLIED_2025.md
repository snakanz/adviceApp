## ‚úÖ Issue 1: Database Migration Error - FIXED

### **Problem:**
The annual review migration (`011_annual_review_tracking.sql`) was failing with error:
```
ERROR: 42703: column c.userid does not exist
```

### **Root Cause:**
The migration SQL was referencing `c.userid` in the `create_annual_review_records_for_year` function, but the `clients` table uses `advisor_id` (not `userid`) to link clients to advisors.

### **Fix Applied:**
**File:** `backend/migrations/011_annual_review_tracking.sql` (Line 124)

**Changed:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.id as client_id, c.userid as advisor_id
```

**To:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.id as client_id, c.advisor_id as advisor_id
```

### **How to Run the Migration:**

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your Advicly project
   - Click "SQL Editor" ‚Üí "New Query"

2. **Copy and Run:**
   - Open `backend/migrations/011_annual_review_tracking.sql`
   - Copy the **entire file contents**
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" (or press Cmd+Enter)

3. **Verify Success:**
   - You should see "Success. No rows returned"
   - Run this verification query:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, data_type 
   FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'meetings' 
   AND column_name = 'is_annual_review';
   ```
   - Should return one row showing the `is_annual_review` column

4. **Wait for Backend Deployment:**
   - Render will auto-deploy the backend (2-5 minutes)
   - Check https://dashboard.render.com/ for deployment status

5. **Test the Feature:**
   - Refresh your Advicly app
   - Go to Meetings page
   - Click a meeting to open detail panel
   - Click the star button ‚≠ê
   - Should see amber "Annual Review" badge appear!

## ‚úÖ Issue 2: BusinessTypeManager Modal Input Fields Not Clickable - FIXED

### **Problem:**
When opening the Business Type Manager modal from the Pipeline page:
- Input fields were not clickable/focusable
- Modal appeared to shift or move when clicking on fields
- Select dropdowns were appearing behind the modal backdrop

### **Root Cause:**
**Z-Index Stacking Context Issue:**

The problem was a z-index conflict between multiple layers:
1. **Detail Panel:** `z-50` (Pipeline sidebar)
2. **Modal Backdrop:** `z-[60]` (Pipeline modal)
3. **Select Dropdown:** `z-50` (Select component Portal)

The Select dropdown was rendering in a Portal with `z-50`, which was **the same as** the detail panel and **lower than** the modal backdrop (`z-[60]`). This caused the dropdown to appear behind the modal, making it seem like inputs weren't working.

### **Fixes Applied:**

#### **1. Updated Select Component Z-Index**
**File:** `src/components/ui/select.js` (Line 62)

**Changed:**
```javascript
className={cn(
  "relative z-50 max-h-96 min-w-[8rem] overflow-hidden rounded-md border bg-popover..."
```

**To:**
```javascript
className={cn(
  "relative z-[100] max-h-96 min-w-[8rem] overflow-hidden rounded-md border bg-popover..."
```

**Why:** This ensures Select dropdowns always appear above modals and detail panels.

---

#### **2. Updated Pipeline Modal Z-Index**
**File:** `src/pages/Pipeline.js` (Lines 1141-1142)

**Changed:**
```javascript
<div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 z-[60] flex items-center justify-center p-4">
  <div className="bg-background rounded-lg shadow-xl max-w-4xl w-full max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto">
```

**To:**
```javascript
<div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 z-[100] flex items-center justify-center p-4">
  <div className="bg-background rounded-lg shadow-xl max-w-4xl w-full max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto relative z-[100]">
```

**Why:** Ensures the modal and its contents are at the highest z-index level.

---

#### **3. Updated Clients Modal Z-Index (for consistency)**
**File:** `src/pages/Clients.js` (Lines 1280-1281)

**Changed:**
```javascript
<div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 flex items-center justify-center z-50">
  <div className="bg-background p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg w-full max-w-4xl max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto">
```

**To:**
```javascript
<div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 flex items-center justify-center z-[100]">
  <div className="bg-background p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg w-full max-w-4xl max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto relative z-[100]">
```

**Why:** Maintains consistency across both pages and prevents similar issues.

---

### **Z-Index Hierarchy (After Fix):**

```
z-[100] - Modals & Select Dropdowns (Highest)
z-50    - Detail Panels
z-40    - Mobile Overlays
z-0     - Normal Content (Lowest)
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

Both issues have been fixed and code has been pushed to GitHub. The frontend and backend will auto-deploy within 2-5 minutes. The database migration needs to be run manually in Supabase (see instructions above).

Once deployments complete and migration is run, both features should work perfectly! üéâ
