- Full-text search on extracted text
- Auto-detection fields (confidence scoring, detected client)
- Analysis status tracking (pending ‚Üí processing ‚Üí completed/failed)
- Soft delete support (is_deleted flag)
- Comprehensive indexing for performance

### 2. Backend Services ‚úÖ

**New Service:** `backend/src/services/clientDocuments.js`

**Functions Implemented:**
- `uploadToStorage()` - Upload files to Supabase Storage

- File type validation (images, PDFs, documents, audio, video)
- Automatic file categorization
- Unique filename generation
- Error handling and validation

### 3. API Routes ‚úÖ

**New Routes File:** `backend/src/routes/clientDocuments.js`

**Endpoints Implemented:**
- `POST /api/client-documents/upload` - Bulk upload with optional client assignment
- `GET /api/client-documents/:clientId` - List all client documents
- `GET /api/client-documents/unassigned/list` - Get unassigned documents

**Mounted in:** `backend/src/index.js` line 1287

### 4. Frontend Components ‚úÖ

**New Component:** `src/components/ClientDocumentsManager.js`

**Features:**
- üì§ Drag-and-drop file upload
- üìÅ Grid view of documents with thumbnails
- üè∑Ô∏è File category icons (image, document, audio, video)

### 5. Integration ‚úÖ

**Enhanced:** `src/pages/ViewClient.js`

**Changes:**
- Added "Documents" tab alongside AI Summary, Meetings, Pipeline
- Integrated `ClientDocumentsManager` component
- Added FileText icon import
- Proper tab navigation

**User Flow:**
1. Navigate to any client
2. Click "Documents" tab
3. Upload documents via drag-drop or file picker
4. View documents in grid layout
5. Download or delete as needed

### 6. UI Bug Fix ‚úÖ

**Fixed:** `src/pages/Pipeline.js` line 747

**Issue:** "Needs Attention" section had fixed height causing overflow on small screens

**Solution:**
- Changed `max-h-96` to `max-h-[40vh] lg:max-h-96`
- Added `overflow-x-hidden` to prevent horizontal scroll
- Made layout responsive with `flex-col sm:flex-row`
- Adjusted min-widths for better mobile display

## üéØ What's Next (Sprint 2)

Now that the foundation is in place, Sprint 2 will add:

1. **PDF Text Extraction** - Use `pdf-parse` to extract text from PDFs
2. **OCR Integration** - OpenAI Vision API for images
3. **Background Worker** - Process the analysis queue
4. **Entity Extraction** - Extract names, emails, amounts, dates
5. **Auto-Detection Algorithm** - Automatically assign documents to clients
6. **Confidence Scoring** - Calculate match confidence (0-1)

---

## üí° Key Decisions Made

1. **Soft Delete** - Documents marked as deleted, not physically removed (for audit trail)
2. **Signed URLs** - 1-hour expiry for security
3. **Queue-Based Processing** - Async AI analysis to avoid blocking uploads
4. **Client-Optional** - Documents can be uploaded without client assignment (for auto-detection)
5. **Priority System** - Unassigned docs get higher priority (for faster auto-detection)
6. **Multer Memory Storage** - Files buffered in memory for direct Supabase upload
7. **File Size Limit** - 50MB max per file, 10 files per upload
8. **Category Auto-Detection** - Based on MIME type

---

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Indexes** - Added on all foreign keys and frequently queried fields
- **Full-Text Search** - GIN index on extracted_text for fast search
- **Signed URLs** - Cached for 1 hour to reduce API calls
- **Batch Upload** - Support up to 10 files at once
- **Lazy Loading** - Documents fetched only when tab opened
- **Responsive Images** - Grid layout adapts to screen size

---

## üîí Security Features

- **JWT Authentication** - All routes require valid token
- **Advisor Ownership** - Users can only access their own documents
- **Client Verification** - Client must belong to advisor
- **Private Storage** - Bucket not publicly accessible
- **RLS Policies** - Row-level security on storage
- **Signed URLs** - Time-limited access to files
- **File Type Validation** - Only allowed MIME types
- **Size Limits** - Prevent abuse with 50MB limit

---

## üöÄ Deployment Readiness

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready to Deploy

**Risk Level:** üü¢ Low
