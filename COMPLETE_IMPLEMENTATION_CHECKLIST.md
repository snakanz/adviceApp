## ✔️ STEP 3: VERIFY DATABASE STRUCTURE (5 minutes)

### Verify Clean Schema

**Run verification queries in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Query 1: Check all 11 tables exist
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
ask_messages
ask_threads

clients
meetings
pipeline_activities
transcript_action_items
users
(11 rows)
```

**Verification Confirmation:**
- [ ] All 11 tables exist
- [ ] No extra tables
- [ ] No deprecated tables

```sql
-- Query 2: Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
All tables have rowsecurity = true
```

**RLS Confirmation:**
- [ ] All 11 tables have RLS enabled
- [ ] No tables have RLS disabled

```sql
-- Query 3: Check RLS policies exist
SELECT COUNT(*) as policy_count FROM pg_policies

**Expected Result:**
```
policy_count: 11 (at least one policy per table)
```

**Policy Confirmation:**
- [ ] At least 11 policies created
- [ ] Each table has at least one policy

provider: google
is_active: true
last_sync_at: (Recent timestamp)
```

**Calendar Connection Confirmation:**

**In Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Verify RLS works (only user's data)
SELECT COUNT(*) as user_count FROM users;
-- Expected: 1 (only current user)

SELECT COUNT(*) as meeting_count FROM meetings;
-- Expected: > 0 (user's meetings)

SELECT COUNT(*) as client_count FROM clients;
-- Expected: >= 0 (user's clients)
```

**Success Confirmation:**
- [ ] User can log in
- [ ] Meetings appear
- [ ] Calendar connected
- [ ] No errors in console
- [ ] RLS policies work
- [ ] Data isolation verified

## 🔧 STEP 7: UPDATE BACKEND CODE (If Needed)

### Check Backend Code

**Backend should already use correct column names:**
- `user_id` (not `userid` or `advisor_id`)
- `external_id` (not `googleeventid`)

**If you see errors like:**
- "Column 'userid' does not exist"
- "Column 'advisor_id' does not exist"

**Then update backend code:**

**Files to check:**
- [ ] backend/src/routes/auth.js
- [ ] backend/src/routes/calendar.js
- [ ] backend/src/routes/clients.js
- [ ] backend/src/routes/meetings.js
- [ ] backend/src/services/googleCalendarWebhook.js

**Find and replace:**
```
OLD: .eq('userid', userId)
NEW: .eq('user_id', userId)

OLD: .eq('advisor_id', userId)
NEW: .eq('user_id', userId)

OLD: .select('userid')
NEW: .select('user_id')

OLD: { userid: userId }
NEW: { user_id: userId }
```

**Backend Update Confirmation:**
- [ ] All column names updated
- [ ] No references to old column names
- [ ] Backend tests pass
- [ ] No errors in backend logs

---

## 🚀 STEP 8: DEPLOY & MONITOR

### Deploy Changes

```
1. Commit backend code changes (if any)
2. Push to main branch
3. Render auto-deploys
4. Monitor backend logs
5. Verify no errors
```

**Deployment Confirmation:**
- [ ] Code committed
- [ ] Code pushed to main
- [ ] Render deployment started
- [ ] Deployment completed
- [ ] No errors in logs

---

- [ ] Add retry logic for failed syncs
- [ ] Add error logging and monitoring
- [ ] Add webhook status dashboard

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Table already exists"
**Solution:** Drop schema and recreate
```sql
DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA public;
-- Then run DATABASE_WIPE_AND_CLEAN_SCHEMA.sql again
```

### Issue: "RLS policy violation"
**Solution:** Check RLS policies
```sql
SELECT tablename, policyname, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

### Issue: "User can't log in"
**Solution:** Check users table
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
-- If empty, user needs to re-register
```

### Issue: "Meetings not showing"
**Solution:** Check calendar connection
```sql
SELECT * FROM calendar_connections;
-- If empty, user needs to connect calendar
```
