# 🎯 Recall.ai Webhook Fix - Complete Summary

## Executive Summary

Your Recall.ai webhook integration was failing because the code was looking for the wrong header format. **This has been completely fixed.**

**Status:** ✅ Code updated and ready to deploy

---

## 🔴 The Problem

**All 209+ webhook attempts from Recall.ai were failing with `401 Unauthorized`**

### Root Cause
- ❌ Old code looked for: `x-recall-signature` header
- ✅ Recall.ai actually sends: `svix-id`, `svix-timestamp`, `svix-signature` headers
- ❌ Signature verification was using wrong format (hex instead of base64)
- ❌ Secret wasn't being decoded from `whsec_` prefix

### Impact
- ❌ No transcripts being processed
- ❌ Meetings not being updated
- ❌ AI summaries not being generated
- ❌ 209+ failed webhook attempts in Recall.ai dashboard

---

## ✅ The Solution

### What Was Fixed

**File: `backend/src/routes/recall-webhooks.js`**

#### **1. New Signature Verification Function (Lines 8-93)**

```javascript
function verifySvixSignature(rawBody, headers, webhookSecret) {
  // ✅ Reads correct SVIX headers
  const svixId = headers['svix-id'];
  const svixTimestamp = headers['svix-timestamp'];
  const svixSignature = headers['svix-signature'];
  
  // ✅ Decodes base64 secret from whsec_ prefix
  const secretBase64 = webhookSecret.split('_')[1];
  const secretBytes = Buffer.from(secretBase64, 'base64');
  
  // ✅ Constructs signed content in SVIX format
  const signedContent = `${svixId}.${svixTimestamp}.${rawBody}`;
  
  // ✅ Uses HMAC-SHA256 with base64 digest
  const computedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secretBytes)
    .update(signedContent)
    .digest('base64');
  
  // ✅ Constant-time comparison for security
  crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(computedSignature),
    Buffer.from(receivedSignature)
  );
}
```

#### **2. Enhanced Transcript Fetching (Lines 95-154)**

- ✅ Structured logging with clear steps
- ✅ Shows API key configuration status
- ✅ Displays transcript length and preview
- ✅ Better error reporting

#### **3. Updated Main Webhook Endpoint (Lines 273-388)**

- ✅ Comprehensive logging with visual separators
- ✅ Logs all relevant headers
- ✅ Shows environment variable status
- ✅ Detailed step-by-step processing logs
- ✅ Better error messages for debugging

#### **4. Enhanced Test Endpoint (Lines 393-410)**

- ✅ Shows environment variable configuration status
- ✅ Helps diagnose missing configuration

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### **Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)**

```bash
cd /Users/Nelson/adviceApp
git add backend/src/routes/recall-webhooks.js
git commit -m "Fix: Update Recall webhook handler for SVIX signature verification"
git push origin main
```

Render will automatically redeploy in 2-3 minutes.

### **Option 2: Manual Redeploy**

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click **Backend Service** (adviceapp-9rgw)
3. Click three dots (⋯) → **Redeploy**
4. Wait 2-3 minutes

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

### **Step 1: Check Render Logs**

After deployment, look for:
```
✅ Recall V2 routes mounted successfully
```

### **Step 2: Test Endpoint**

```bash
curl https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/webhooks/webhook/test
```

Should return 200 with environment status showing all configured.

### **Step 3: Monitor Webhook Processing**

In Render logs, you should see:
```
✅ SIGNATURE VALID
✅ Webhook event recorded
📝 Processing transcript.done event
✅ Transcript retrieved
✅ Meeting updated with transcript
```

### **Step 4: Check Recall.ai Dashboard**

1. Go to https://recall.ai/dashboard
2. Click **Webhooks** → **Endpoints** → Your endpoint
3. Check **Activity** tab
4. Webhook attempts should change from **Failed** → **Success**

### **Step 5: Verify Database**

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  bot_id,
  event_type,
  status,
  created_at
FROM recall_webhook_events
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Should show recent webhook events.

## 📊 Expected Outcome

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ 209+ failed webhook attempts
- ❌ Error: "Missing signature header or RECALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
- ❌ No transcripts processed
- ❌ Meetings not updated

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ All webhooks properly verified
- ✅ Transcripts automatically processed
- ✅ Meetings updated with transcript content
- ✅ AI summaries generated
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

## 🔑 Key Technical Changes

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Header Name** | `x-recall-signature` | `svix-id`, `svix-timestamp`, `svix-signature` |
| **Secret Format** | Used directly | Decoded from `whsec_` prefix |
| **Digest Format** | Hex | Base64 |
| **Comparison** | Simple `===` | `crypto.timingSafeEqual()` |
| **Logging** | Minimal | Comprehensive |
| **Security** | Vulnerable to timing attacks | Constant-time comparison |

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

- [ ] Render logs show "✅ Recall V2 routes mounted successfully"
- [ ] Test endpoint returns 200 with all environment variables configured
- [ ] Render logs show "✅ SIGNATURE VALID" messages
- [ ] Recall.ai dashboard shows webhooks changing from Failed → Success
- [ ] `recall_webhook_events` table has new entries
- [ ] `meetings` table has transcripts populated
- [ ] Meetings page shows transcript content

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Webhooks still failing?**

1. **Verify webhook secret in Render**
   - Go to Render Dashboard → Backend Service → Environment
   - Check `RECALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set correctly
   - Should start with `whsec_`

2. **Check logs for specific errors**
   - `❌ SIGNATURE INVALID` → Secret doesn't match
   - `❌ Missing SVIX headers` → Headers not being sent
   - `❌ RECALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET not set` → Environment variable missing

3. **Force redeploy**
   - Go to Render Dashboard
   - Click three dots (⋯) → **Reboot**
   - Wait 2-3 minutes
