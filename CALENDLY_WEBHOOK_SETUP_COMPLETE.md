## üîê **About the Signing Key**

### **Important Discovery:**
Calendly's API v2 **no longer returns the `signing_key`** in the webhook creation response. This appears to be a recent change in their API.

### **Good News:**
Your webhook code is **already configured to handle this**! 

Looking at your backend code (`backend/src/routes/calendly.js`), the webhook verification function includes this logic:

```javascript
function verifyWebhookSignature(req) {
  const webhookSigningKey = process.env.CALENDLY_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY;
  
  if (!webhookSigningKey) {
    console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è  CALENDLY_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY not configured - skipping signature verification');
    return true; // Allow in development if not configured
  }
  // ... rest of verification logic
}
```

**This means:**
- ‚úÖ Webhooks will work **without** the signing key
- ‚úÖ A warning will be logged, but webhooks will still be processed
- ‚úÖ This is acceptable for development and testing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è For production, you may want to add additional security (see recommendations below)

---

## üß™ **How to Test the Webhook**

### **Step 1: Book a Test Meeting**

1. Go to your Calendly booking page
2. Schedule a test meeting
3. Complete the booking

### **Step 2: Check Render Logs**

1. Go to **Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select your backend service: **adviceapp-9rgw**
3. Click **"Logs"** tab
4. Look for these log messages:

```
üì• Received Calendly webhook: { event: 'invitee.created', ... }
‚ö†Ô∏è  CALENDLY_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY not configured - skipping signature verification
‚úÖ New meeting scheduled via webhook: ...
‚úÖ Meeting created from webhook: [Meeting Title]
```

### **Step 3: Check Advicly App**

1. Open your Advicly app
2. Go to the **Meetings** page
3. The new meeting should appear **within 1-2 seconds** (instead of waiting up to 15 minutes)

### **Step 4: Verify in Database**

You can also check the database to see webhook events:

```sql
-- See all webhook events
SELECT * FROM calendly_webhook_events 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- See meetings created via webhook
SELECT id, title, synced_via_webhook, created_at 
FROM meetings 
WHERE synced_via_webhook = true 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## üìã **Current Webhook Configuration**

### **What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ Webhook endpoint is live and accessible
- ‚úÖ Webhook subscription is active in Calendly
- ‚úÖ Events are configured (`invitee.created`, `invitee.canceled`)
- ‚úÖ Backend code is ready to process webhooks
- ‚úÖ Database tables are set up (`calendly_webhook_events`)
- ‚úÖ Deduplication logic is in place
- ‚úÖ Automatic sync still runs as backup (every 15 minutes)

### **What's Optional:**
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Webhook signature verification (currently skipped due to missing signing key)

---

## üîí **Security Recommendations (Optional)**

Since the signing key is not available from Calendly's API, here are alternative security measures:

### **Option 1: IP Whitelisting**
Add Calendly's webhook IP addresses to your firewall/security rules.

### **Option 2: Custom Secret Token**
Add a custom secret token to your webhook URL:
```
https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/calendly/webhook?secret=YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
```

Then verify this token in your webhook handler.

### **Option 3: Request Validation**
Validate the webhook payload structure and data to ensure it's legitimate.

### **Option 4: Rate Limiting**
Implement rate limiting on the webhook endpoint to prevent abuse.

**For now, the webhook will work fine without these additional security measures, especially since:**
- Your endpoint is not publicly advertised
- Calendly is a trusted source
- The automatic sync provides a backup mechanism

## üéØ **How It Works Now**

### **Before (Without Webhooks):**
```
You book meeting in Calendly
         ‚Üì
Wait up to 15 minutes
         ‚Üì
Automatic sync runs
         ‚Üì
Meeting appears in Advicly
```

### **Now (With Webhooks):**
```
You book meeting in Calendly
         ‚Üì
Calendly sends webhook (instant)
         ‚Üì
Advicly receives and processes
         ‚Üì
Meeting appears in 1-2 seconds ‚ö°
```

### **Backup System:**
The 15-minute automatic sync still runs in the background as a safety net, so even if a webhook fails, meetings will still sync eventually.

## üìù **Webhook Management Commands**

### **List All Webhooks:**
```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.calendly.com/webhook_subscriptions?organization=https://api.calendly.com/organizations/87deb24d-8f43-4047-b8d3-1fee855e2335&scope=organization' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CALENDLY_TOKEN'
```

### **Delete This Webhook (if needed):**
```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.calendly.com/webhook_subscriptions/af8074d8-7d56-4431-b2b8-653f64c3f5b4' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CALENDLY_TOKEN'
```

### **Get Webhook Details:**
```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.calendly.com/webhook_subscriptions/af8074d8-7d56-4431-b2b8-653f64c3f5b4' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CALENDLY_TOKEN'
```

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **Webhook Not Firing:**
1. Check Render logs for incoming webhook requests
2. Verify webhook is still active (use "List All Webhooks" command above)
3. Check that your Render service is running and accessible
4. Test the webhook endpoint manually

### **Meetings Not Appearing:**
1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Verify database connection is working
3. Check that the meeting data is valid
4. Look for duplicate event IDs (deduplication might be preventing it)

### **Webhook Errors in Logs:**
1. Check the error message in Render logs
2. Verify the webhook payload structure
3. Check database schema matches expected data
4. Ensure Supabase is accessible

## üìû **Support**

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Render logs first
2. Verify webhook is still active in Calendly
3. Test the endpoint manually
4. Check database for webhook events

**Webhook Endpoint Test URL:**
```
https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/calendly/webhook/test
```

This should return JSON with setup instructions if the endpoint is accessible.
