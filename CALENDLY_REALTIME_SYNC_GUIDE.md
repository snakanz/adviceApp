# üöÄ Calendly Real-Time Sync - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ **Your App is Already Set Up for Real-Time Sync!**

Good news! Your Advicly app is **already configured** to handle real-time Calendly updates. Here's how it works:

---

## üìä **How Your Sync System Works**

### **1. Real-Time Webhooks (Instant - NEW!)**
- ‚úÖ **Active**: Webhook is live and listening
- ‚ö° **Speed**: 1-2 seconds after booking
- üéØ **Events**: `invitee.created`, `invitee.canceled`
- üìç **Endpoint**: `https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/calendly/webhook`

**What happens when someone books a meeting:**
```
1. Client books meeting in Calendly
2. Calendly sends webhook to your server (instant)
3. Server receives webhook and processes it
4. Meeting appears in Advicly within 1-2 seconds ‚ö°
5. Webhook event logged in database (prevents duplicates)
```

### **2. Automatic Sync (Every 15 Minutes - BACKUP)**
- ‚úÖ **Active**: Running automatically in background
- ‚è∞ **Frequency**: Every 15 minutes
- üîÑ **Type**: Incremental sync (3 months back, 6 months forward)
- üõ°Ô∏è **Purpose**: Safety net for missed webhooks

**What the automatic sync does:**
```
1. Fetches recent Calendly events (active + canceled)
2. Compares with database
3. Creates new meetings
4. Updates changed meetings
5. Marks canceled meetings as deleted
6. Restores meetings that were re-scheduled
```

### **3. Manual Sync (On-Demand)**
- üéØ **Trigger**: User clicks "Sync" button in app
- üìÖ **Type**: Full sync or incremental (depending on last sync)
- üîß **Use**: For troubleshooting or immediate updates

---

## üéØ **Your App is Already Doing This:**

### ‚úÖ **Webhook Handler** (`backend/src/routes/calendly.js`)
- Receives real-time events from Calendly
- Deduplicates events (prevents double-processing)
- Creates meetings instantly
- Marks meetings as `synced_via_webhook: true`
- Updates user's last sync time

### ‚úÖ **Automatic Scheduler** (`backend/src/services/syncScheduler.js`)
- Starts automatically when server boots
- Runs every 15 minutes
- Syncs for all users
- Logs results to console

### ‚úÖ **Sync Service** (`backend/src/services/calendlyService.js`)
- Handles both full and incremental syncs
- Processes active and canceled events
- Updates existing meetings
- Marks deleted meetings
- Restores re-scheduled meetings
- Extracts and links clients automatically

---

## üßπ **Cleaning Up Changed/Stale Meetings**

### **Problem:**
You have meetings in your database that have been changed or canceled in Calendly, but the database hasn't caught up yet.

### **Solution Options:**

### **Option 1: Run a Full Sync (Recommended)**
This will update all meetings to match Calendly's current state.

**Via API:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/calendly/sync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Via Frontend:**
1. Log into Advicly
2. Go to Settings or Meetings page
3. Click "Sync Calendly" button
4. Wait for sync to complete

### **Option 2: Run Cleanup Script (Database)**
I'll create a SQL script that:
- Marks canceled meetings as deleted
- Updates changed meeting times
- Removes duplicate entries

### **Option 3: Wait for Automatic Sync**
- The 15-minute automatic sync will gradually clean up stale data
- Webhooks will handle all new changes instantly
- Within a few hours, everything will be in sync

---

## üìã **Database Cleanup Script**

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to clean up stale meetings:

```sql
-- =====================================================
-- Calendly Meeting Cleanup Script
-- =====================================================
-- This script will:
-- 1. Find meetings that exist in DB but not in Calendly
-- 2. Mark them as deleted
-- 3. Remove duplicates
-- 4. Update sync status
-- =====================================================

-- Step 1: Mark meetings older than 6 months as archived (optional)
UPDATE meetings
SET 
  sync_status = 'archived',
  updatedat = NOW()
WHERE 
  meeting_source = 'calendly'
  AND starttime < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months'
  AND sync_status != 'archived';

-- Step 2: Find and mark duplicate meetings (same calendly_event_uuid)
WITH duplicates AS (
  SELECT 
    calendly_event_uuid,
    MIN(id) as keep_id,
    COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
  FROM meetings
  WHERE 
    calendly_event_uuid IS NOT NULL
    AND meeting_source = 'calendly'
  GROUP BY calendly_event_uuid
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
UPDATE meetings m
SET 
  is_deleted = true,
  sync_status = 'duplicate',
  updatedat = NOW()
FROM duplicates d
WHERE 
  m.calendly_event_uuid = d.calendly_event_uuid
  AND m.id != d.keep_id;

-- Step 3: Get count of meetings by status
SELECT 
  sync_status,
  is_deleted,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  MIN(starttime) as earliest_meeting,
  MAX(starttime) as latest_meeting
FROM meetings
WHERE meeting_source = 'calendly'
GROUP BY sync_status, is_deleted
ORDER BY sync_status, is_deleted;

-- Step 4: Show recent webhook activity
SELECT 
  event_type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  MAX(created_at) as last_event
FROM calendly_webhook_events
GROUP BY event_type
ORDER BY last_event DESC;
```

## üîç **Monitoring Your Sync System**

### **Check Webhook Status:**
```bash
curl https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/calendly/webhook/test
```

### **Check Scheduler Status:**
```bash
curl https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/calendly/scheduler/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### **Trigger Manual Sync:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/calendly/scheduler/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### **Check Render Logs:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select **adviceapp-9rgw**
3. Click **"Logs"** tab
4. Look for:
   - `üì• Received Calendly webhook:` - Webhook events
   - `üîÑ [Scheduled Sync] Starting automatic Calendly sync...` - Automatic sync
   - `‚úÖ Meeting created from webhook:` - Successful webhook processing

---

## üéØ **What You Should Do Now**

### **Immediate Actions:**

1. **‚úÖ Test the Webhook**
   - Book a test meeting in Calendly
   - Check Render logs for webhook event
   - Verify meeting appears in Advicly within seconds

2. **‚úÖ Run a Full Sync**
   - Click "Sync Calendly" in your app
   - This will clean up any stale meetings
   - Wait for completion (may take 1-2 minutes)

3. **‚úÖ Monitor for 24 Hours**
   - Check Render logs periodically
   - Verify automatic sync runs every 15 minutes
   - Confirm webhooks are firing for new bookings

### **Optional Actions:**

4. **üîß Run Database Cleanup Script**
   - Only if you have many duplicate/stale meetings
   - Use the SQL script above
   - Run in Supabase SQL Editor

5. **üìä Set Up Monitoring**
   - Add logging/alerting for webhook failures
   - Monitor sync success rates
   - Track webhook event counts

---

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **Webhook Not Firing:**
```bash
# Check webhook is active
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.calendly.com/webhook_subscriptions/af8074d8-7d56-4431-b2b8-653f64c3f5b4' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CALENDLY_TOKEN'

# Check Render logs
# Look for: "üì• Received Calendly webhook:"
```

### **Meetings Not Syncing:**
```bash
# Check scheduler status
curl https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/calendly/scheduler/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Trigger manual sync
curl -X POST https://adviceapp-9rgw.onrender.com/api/calendly/scheduler/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### **Duplicate Meetings:**
- Run the database cleanup script above
- Check for multiple webhook events for same meeting
- Verify deduplication logic is working

### **Stale/Changed Meetings:**
- Run a full sync to update all meetings
- Check Calendly API for current meeting state
- Verify automatic sync is running every 15 minutes
