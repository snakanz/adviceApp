# Calendar Integration Fixes - Complete Summary

## Overview
Successfully fixed all critical calendar integration issues for user `snaka1003@gmail.com`. The system now properly saves calendar connections to the database, displays correct integration status, and eliminates duplicate window problems.

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Missing Calendly Data After Login ✅
**Problem**: Previously synced Calendly meetings and clients not displaying after login.

**Root Cause**: `calendarService.listMeetings()` only queried Google Calendar API, not the database where Calendly meetings were stored.

**Solution**: Updated `calendarService.listMeetings()` to query the database for all meeting sources (Google, Calendly, manual, Outlook) instead of individual calendar APIs.

**Files Modified**: `backend/src/services/calendar.js`

---

### 2. Calendar Connections Not Saving to Database ✅
**Problem**: Calendar connections were failing to save, causing empty `calendar_connections` table.

**Root Cause**: The `calendar_connections` table requires a `tenant_id` foreign key (NOT NULL), but calendar connection inserts were missing this field. Users don't have a `tenant_id` until they complete onboarding Step 2.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `backend/src/routes/auth.js` to create a default tenant automatically when user logs in via Google OAuth
- Updated `backend/src/routes/calendar.js` Calendly callback to include `tenant_id` when creating connections
- Updated `backend/src/routes/calendar-settings.js` to fetch and include `tenant_id` when creating Calendly connections

**Files Modified**: 
- `backend/src/routes/auth.js`
- `backend/src/routes/calendar.js`
- `backend/src/routes/calendar-settings.js`

---

### 3. Duplicate Window/Screen Problem on Login ✅
**Problem**: Two screens/windows appearing on login, background window shows authentication error.

**Root Cause**: Google OAuth callback was using `window.location.href` for full page redirect, causing the main window to navigate away while the OAuth popup was still open.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `/api/auth/google` to return URL instead of redirecting
- Updated `/api/auth/google/callback` to detect `state` parameter and handle popup-based reconnection
- When `state` parameter present, callback sends `postMessage` to parent window instead of redirecting
- Popup auto-closes after successful connection
- Frontend now opens Google OAuth in popup window instead of full page redirect

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/routes/calendar.js`
- `src/components/CalendarSettings.js`

---

### 4. Incorrect Integration Status Display ✅
**Problem**: Calendly showing as "failed" or disconnected (red X) when it should show as connected (green checkmark).

**Root Cause**: `calendar_connections` table was empty because inserts were failing due to missing `tenant_id`.

**Solution**: Fixed by resolving Issue #2 above. Now that connections are being saved properly, the status display works correctly.

**Files Modified**: `src/components/ConnectedIntegrations.js`

---

### 5. Automatic Connection Detection on Login ✅
**Problem**: Calendar integration should work automatically without user action after login.

**Status**: Now working. Calendar connections are being saved to database and automatically detected on login.

**Verification Needed**: Confirm webhooks are working for automatic meeting sync.

## Technical Changes Summary

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Auto-create Default Tenant on Google OAuth Login
**File**: `backend/src/routes/auth.js`
- When user logs in via Google OAuth, check if they have a `tenant_id`
- If not, create a default tenant automatically
- Update user record with new `tenant_id`
- This ensures users have a tenant before calendar connections are created

#### 2. Include tenant_id in Calendar Connection Inserts
**Files**: 
- `backend/src/routes/calendar.js` (Calendly OAuth callback)
- `backend/src/routes/calendar-settings.js` (Calendly token connection)

- Fetch user's `tenant_id` before creating calendar connection
- Include `tenant_id` in all `calendar_connections` insert statements
- Validate that user has a `tenant_id` before proceeding

#### 3. Popup-based Google OAuth Reconnection
**File**: `backend/src/routes/calendar.js`
- Modified `/api/auth/google` endpoint to return URL instead of redirecting
- Updated `/api/auth/google/callback` to handle both:
  - **Initial login** (no state parameter): Redirect to `/auth/callback` with JWT token
  - **Popup reconnection** (state parameter present): Send `postMessage` to parent window and close popup
- Callback detects `state` parameter to determine which flow to use

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Popup-based Google OAuth
**File**: `src/components/CalendarSettings.js`
- `handleReconnectGoogle()` now opens OAuth in popup window instead of full page redirect
- Passes user ID in `state` parameter for backend to identify user
- Polls for popup closure and reloads connections after successful auth
- Handles `postMessage` events from popup window

#### 2. OAuth Message Handling
**File**: `src/components/CalendarSettings.js`
- Added listeners for `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SUCCESS` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_ERROR` messages
- Displays success/error messages to user
- Reloads calendar connections after successful OAuth
