# Pipeline Page - Three Critical Issues Fixed

## 🎯 **All Three Issues Resolved!**

Fixed three separate but related issues with the Client Pipeline page that were preventing proper display of business types, amounts, and month columns.

---

## ❌ **ISSUE 1: Pipeline Month Display & Visibility**

### **Problem:**
- Clients with business types not appearing in correct month columns based on expected_close_date
- Some clients not visible at all in pipeline view
- Example: **Samantha Jones** should appear in October 2025 column but was either in wrong month or not showing

### **Root Cause:**
**File:** `src/pages/Pipeline.js` (line 414)

```javascript
// OLD CODE - Excluded clients without pipeline_stage
if (!client.businessStage || client.businessStage === 'Need to Book Meeting') {
  return false;  // ❌ Hides ALL clients without pipeline stage
}
```

**The Problem:**
- Filter logic excluded clients without `pipeline_stage` set
- Clients with business types but no pipeline stage were completely hidden
- This prevented newly added business types from appearing in pipeline view
- User adds business type with expected close date → Client still invisible

### **Solution:**
**File:** `src/pages/Pipeline.js` (lines 407-456)

Modified both `getOverdueOrNoDateClients()` and `getCurrentMonthClients()` functions:

```javascript
// NEW CODE - Include clients with business types
const hasBusinessTypes = client.businessTypes && client.businessTypes.length > 0;
if (!hasBusinessTypes && (!client.businessStage || client.businessStage === 'Need to Book Meeting')) {
  return false;  // ✅ Only hide clients with BOTH no business types AND no pipeline stage
}
```

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Check if client has business types before filtering
2. ✅ Only skip clients that have BOTH no business types AND no pipeline stage
3. ✅ Clients with business types now visible regardless of pipeline stage
4. ✅ Month column calculated from earliest `expected_close_date` in business types

---

## ❌ **ISSUE 2: Total Business Amount Not Displaying**

### **Problem:**
- After saving business types via "Manage Business Types" dialog, total business amount did NOT appear on pipeline card
- Only IAF Expected was displayed (in the "IAF Expected" column)
- Business type data WAS saved correctly (visible when clicking "Manage" again)
- Pipeline card not refreshing or recalculating totals after save

### **Root Cause:**

**1. Display Issue:**
**File:** `src/pages/Pipeline.js` (line 816)

```javascript
// OLD CODE - Only showed IAF Expected
<div className="text-sm font-bold text-foreground mb-0.5">
  {formatCurrency(client.expectedValue)}  // ❌ Only IAF Expected
</div>
```

**The Problem:**
- Line 125: `totalBusinessAmount` was calculated from backend data
- Line 816: Card only displayed `expectedValue` (which is IAF Expected)
- User couldn't see the business amounts they just entered
- No visual feedback that business types were saved

**2. State Update Issue:**
**File:** `src/pages/Pipeline.js` (lines 307-335)

```javascript
// OLD CODE - Did not update selectedClient state
const handleSaveBusinessTypes = async (businessTypes) => {
  await api.request(...);
  await fetchPipelineData();  // ✅ Refreshes clients list
  setShowEditPipelineModal(false);
  // ❌ selectedClient still has OLD data!
};
```

**The Problem:**
- `fetchPipelineData()` refreshed the clients list
- But `selectedClient` state was NOT updated
- Detail panel showed old amounts until page refresh

### **Solution:**

**1. Enhanced Pipeline Card Display:**
**File:** `src/pages/Pipeline.js` (lines 812-855)

```javascript
// NEW CODE - Show BOTH Business Amount AND IAF Expected
{/* Show Total Business Amount prominently */}
{client.totalBusinessAmount > 0 && (
  <div className="text-sm font-bold text-foreground mb-0.5">
    {formatCurrency(client.totalBusinessAmount)}
    <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground font-normal ml-1">Business</span>
  </div>
)}

{/* Show IAF Expected below */}
<div className={cn(
  "text-sm font-bold text-foreground",
  client.totalBusinessAmount > 0 ? "text-xs text-muted-foreground font-normal" : "mb-0.5"
)}>
  {formatCurrency(client.expectedValue)}
  {client.totalBusinessAmount > 0 && <span className="ml-1">IAF</span>}
</div>
```

**Display Format:**
```
£150,000 Business  ← Total Business Amount (prominent)
£4,500 IAF         ← IAF Expected (below)
```

**2. Enhanced Business Type Breakdown:**
**File:** `src/pages/Pipeline.js` (lines 827-841)

```javascript
// OLD CODE - Only showed IAF Expected per business type
<span>{formatCurrency(parseFloat(bt.iaf_expected || 0))}</span>

// NEW CODE - Show BOTH amounts per business type
<span>
  {formatCurrency(parseFloat(bt.business_amount || 0))} / 
  {formatCurrency(parseFloat(bt.iaf_expected || 0))} IAF
</span>
```

**Breakdown Format:**
```
Pension: £150,000 / £4,500 IAF
ISA: £50,000 / £1,500 IAF
```

**3. Refresh Selected Client After Save:**
**File:** `src/pages/Pipeline.js` (lines 307-370)

```javascript
// NEW CODE - Update selectedClient with fresh data
const handleSaveBusinessTypes = async (businessTypes) => {
  await api.request(...);
  await fetchPipelineData();  // ✅ Refresh clients list
  
  // ✅ Fetch fresh client data
  const updatedClientData = await api.request(`/clients/${selectedClient.id}`);
  
  // ✅ Recalculate expectedMonth from business_types_data
  const businessTypesData = updatedClientData.business_types_data || [];
  const businessTypeDates = businessTypesData
    .filter(bt => bt.expected_close_date)
    .map(bt => new Date(bt.expected_close_date))
    .sort((a, b) => a - b);
  
  let expectedMonth = null;
  if (businessTypeDates.length > 0) {
    const earliestDate = businessTypeDates[0];
    expectedMonth = `${earliestDate.getFullYear()}-${String(earliestDate.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0')}`;
  }
  
  // ✅ Update selectedClient state with fresh totals
  setSelectedClient({
    ...selectedClient,
    businessTypes: updatedClientData.business_types || [],
    businessTypesData: businessTypesData,
    totalBusinessAmount: parseFloat(updatedClientData.business_amount || 0),
    totalIafExpected: parseFloat(updatedClientData.iaf_expected || 0),
    expectedValue: parseFloat(updatedClientData.iaf_expected || 0),
    expectedMonth: expectedMonth
  });
};
```

**4. Enhanced Overdue Section Display:**
**File:** `src/pages/Pipeline.js` (lines 662-675)

Same dual-amount display for overdue clients - consistent formatting across all pipeline views.

---

## ❌ **ISSUE 3: Old "Add Pipeline" Screen Behind Dialog**

### **Problem:**
- When clicking "Manage Business Types" from a client card in Pipeline view
- An old/deprecated "Add Pipeline" screen appeared blurred out in the background
- Two overlapping screens caused confusion
- Only the "Manage Business Types" dialog should be visible

### **Root Cause:**
**File:** `src/pages/Pipeline.js`

```javascript
// Line 911: handleEditPipeline() opened modal
const handleEditPipeline = async () => {
  setShowEditPipelineModal(true);  // ✅ Opens modal
  // ❌ But detail panel stays open!
};

// Lines 889-1128: Detail panel still rendered
{showDetailPanel && selectedClient && (
  <div>...</div>  // ❌ Appears as blurred background
)}

// Lines 1140-1170: Modal also rendered
{showEditPipelineModal && selectedClient && (
  <div>...</div>  // ✅ Modal on top
)}
```

**The Problem:**
- Both `showDetailPanel` and `showEditPipelineModal` were true simultaneously
- Detail panel appeared as blurred background behind modal
- Confusing UX with two overlapping screens

### **Solution:**
**File:** `src/pages/Pipeline.js` (lines 287-305)

```javascript
// NEW CODE - Hide detail panel when opening modal
const handleEditPipeline = async () => {
  if (!selectedClient) return;

  try {
    const businessTypes = await api.request(`/clients/${selectedClient.id}/business-types`);
    setClientBusinessTypes(businessTypes || []);
    setShowEditPipelineModal(true);
    // ✅ FIX: Hide detail panel to prevent background clutter
    setShowDetailPanel(false);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading business types:', error);
    setClientBusinessTypes([]);
    setShowEditPipelineModal(true);
    // ✅ FIX: Hide detail panel even on error
    setShowDetailPanel(false);
  }
};
```

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Added `setShowDetailPanel(false)` when opening modal
2. ✅ Hide detail panel in both success and error cases
3. ✅ Clean modal display without background clutter
4. ✅ Only "Manage Business Types" dialog visible

✅ Month calculated from earliest `expected_close_date` in business types

✅ IAF Expected shown below business amount  
✅ Both amounts visible in business type breakdown  
✅ Amounts update immediately after saving business types
