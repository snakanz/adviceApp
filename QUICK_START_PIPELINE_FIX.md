# 🚀 Quick Start: Pipeline Data Sync Fix

## ✅ What's Been Done

**Problem:** Pipeline data showing different values in different places  
**Solution:** Established single source of truth using `client_business_types` table  
**Status:** Backend & Frontend deployed ✅

---

## ⚠️ ONE STEP REMAINING

### Run Database Migration (5 minutes)

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project → SQL Editor → New Query

2. **Copy & Run Migration**
   - Open `PIPELINE_DATA_MIGRATION.sql` from project root
   - Copy entire contents
   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click "Run"

3. **Verify**
   - Check the output shows successful migration
   - Review sample data displayed

---

## 🎯 What This Fixes

✅ **Data Consistency**
- Clients page shows same data as Pipeline page
- No more discrepancies between views

✅ **Multiple Business Types**
- Clients can have Pension + ISA + Bond simultaneously
- Each type has its own amount and IAF expected

✅ **Accurate Totals**
- Total IAF = sum of all business types
- Monthly pipeline totals calculate correctly

✅ **Synchronized Updates**
- Edit in one place → updates everywhere
- Add pipeline entry → reflects immediately
- Manage business types → consistent across platform

## 📊 Test After Migration

1. **View a client** → Check business types display
2. **Add pipeline entry** → Verify data saves
3. **Refresh page** → Confirm data persists
4. **Check Pipeline page** → Same data as Clients page
5. **Manage business types** → Add multiple types
