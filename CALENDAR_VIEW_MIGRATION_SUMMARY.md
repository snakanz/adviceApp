## Changes Made

### 1. **Clients Page - Reverted to Table-Only View**

**Removed:**
- ❌ Calendar/List View toggle buttons from header
- ❌ Calendar-related imports: `CalendarDays`, `List`, `ChevronLeft`, `ChevronRight`
- ❌ State variables: `viewMode` and `currentWeekStart`
- ❌ Calendar helper functions:
  - `getWeekDays()` - Generated 7-day week array
  - `getMeetingsForDay(day)` - Filtered meetings by day
  - `isToday(date)` - Checked if date is today
  - `goToPreviousWeek()`, `goToNextWeek()`, `goToToday()` - Week navigation
- ❌ Calendar grid rendering (weekly view with meeting cards)
- ❌ Conditional rendering wrapper `{viewMode === 'list' ? ... : ...}`

**Result:**
- ✅ Clients page now shows **table-only view** (original state)
- ✅ Clean, focused interface for client management
- ✅ All client data visible in sortable table format

### 2. **Meetings Page - Implemented Calendar/List View Toggle**

**Added:**

#### **Imports:**
- ✅ `CalendarDays`, `ChevronLeft`, `ChevronRight`, `CheckCircle2` from lucide-react
- ✅ `Avatar`, `AvatarFallback` from components/ui/avatar

#### **State Variables:**
```javascript
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState('calendar'); // Default to calendar view
const [currentWeekStart, setCurrentWeekStart] = useState(() => {
  const today = new Date();
  const dayOfWeek = today.getDay();
  const weekStart = new Date(today);
  weekStart.setDate(today.getDate() - dayOfWeek);
  weekStart.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  return weekStart;
});
```

#### **Helper Functions:**
- ✅ `getWeekDays()` - Returns array of 7 dates for current week (Sunday-Saturday)
- ✅ `getMeetingsForDay(day)` - Filters all meetings (past + future) for specific day
- ✅ `isToday(date)` - Checks if date matches today
- ✅ `goToPreviousWeek()`, `goToNextWeek()`, `goToToday()` - Week navigation controls
- ✅ `isMeetingComplete(meeting)` - Checks if meeting has transcript, quick_summary, and email_summary_draft

#### **UI Components:**

**View Toggle Buttons:**
```javascript
<div className="flex items-center gap-1 border border-border rounded-lg p-1 bg-background">
  <Button onClick={() => setViewMode('calendar')} variant={viewMode === 'calendar' ? 'default' : 'ghost'}>
    <CalendarDays className="w-4 h-4" />
    Calendar View
  </Button>
  <Button onClick={() => setViewMode('list')} variant={viewMode === 'list' ? 'default' : 'ghost'}>
    <List className="w-4 h-4" />
    List View
  </Button>
</div>
```

**Calendar View Features:**

- ✅ **Week navigation** with Previous/Next buttons and Today button
- ✅ **Today highlighting** with primary color accent
- ✅ **Month/Year display** in calendar header

**Enhanced Meeting Cards:**

Each meeting card in calendar view displays:

1. **Meeting Time** - HH:MM format with Clock icon
2. **Meeting Title** - Prominent, truncated to 2 lines
3. **Client Name with Avatar** - Extracted from attendees data with initials
4. **Meeting Source Badge** - Visual indicator with icon:
   - 🔵 Google Calendar (blue badge with Google icon)
   - 🟠 Calendly (orange badge with "C" icon)
   - ⚪ Manual (gray badge with Outlook icon)
5. **Completion Status Indicators** - Individual badges for:
   - 📄 **Transcript** (green) - FileText icon
   - 💬 **Summary** (blue) - MessageSquare icon
   - 📧 **Email** (purple) - Mail icon
   - ✅ **Actions** (orange) - CheckCircle2 icon
6. **Overall Complete Badge** - Green badge when all components exist

## Technical Implementation

### **Conditional Rendering:**
```javascript
{viewMode === 'list' ? (
  // Existing list view (Past/Today/Upcoming tabs with meeting cards)
  <div className="p-6">
    {/* ... existing meeting list code ... */}
  </div>
) : (
  // New calendar view
  <div className="p-6">
    {/* Calendar header with navigation */}
    {/* 7-day grid with enhanced meeting cards */}
  </div>
)}
```

### **Meeting Data Handling:**
- Combines `meetings.past` and `meetings.future` arrays for calendar view
- Handles different date field formats: `start.dateTime`, `startTime`, `starttime`
- Extracts attendee information using existing `extractAttendees()` function
- Determines meeting source using existing `getMeetingSource()` function

---

## User Experience Improvements

### **Before (Clients Page):**
- Calendar view showed client meetings grouped by client
- Limited to meetings associated with specific clients
- Focused on client-centric view

### **After (Meetings Page):**
- Calendar view shows ALL meetings in chronological order
- Enhanced meeting cards with comprehensive status indicators
- Easy to see which meetings need attention (missing transcript, summary, etc.)
- Professional, information-dense design
- Clear visual indicators for meeting source and completion status
- One-click access to meeting details

---

## Preserved Functionality

✅ **List View** - Existing Past/Today/Upcoming tabs remain unchanged
✅ **Meeting Detail Panel** - Opens when clicking meeting in either view
✅ **Filtering & Search** - All existing filters work in both views
✅ **Meeting Sources** - Google Calendar, Calendly, and Manual meetings all supported
✅ **Attendee Display** - Client names and avatars extracted from attendees
✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes
