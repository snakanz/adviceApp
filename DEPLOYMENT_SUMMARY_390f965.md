# ðŸš€ Deployment Summary - Commit 390f965

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Transcript Upload Endpoint (500 Error)
**Issue:** POST `/api/calendar/meetings/:meetingId/transcript` was failing with 500 error
- Backend queried by `external_id` only
- Frontend sent numeric `id`
- For manual/Calendly meetings, `external_id` is NULL

**Fix:**
- Query by numeric `id` FIRST (works for all meeting types)
- Fallback to `external_id` for Google Calendar meetings
- Added comprehensive logging

**Result:** âœ… Transcript upload now works for all meeting types

---

### 2. Transcript Delete Endpoint (Missing)
**Issue:** DELETE `/api/calendar/meetings/:meetingId/transcript` didn't exist
- Frontend was calling it but getting 404
- User couldn't delete transcripts

**Fix:**
- Created new DELETE endpoint
- Removes transcript AND all related summaries
- Clears: transcript, quick_summary, detailed_summary, email_summary_draft, action_points

**Result:** âœ… Users can now delete transcripts

---

### 3. Schema Mismatch: advisor_id Type
**Issue:** 
- `pending_transcript_action_items.advisor_id` was INTEGER
- `transcript_action_items.advisor_id` was INTEGER
- But `users.id` is UUID
- Foreign key constraint failed

**Fix:**
- Changed both tables: `advisor_id INTEGER` â†’ `advisor_id UUID`
- Updated RLS policies to use `advisor_id = auth.uid()`
- Added priority column to pending_transcript_action_items
- Added RLS policies to both tables

**Result:** âœ… Multi-tenant data isolation now works correctly

---

## Architecture: PRIMARY vs FALLBACK

### PRIMARY PATH (99% of Cases) - Recall.ai Webhook
```
Meeting â†’ Recall.ai Bot Records â†’ Webhook Fires â†’ 
Backend Fetches Transcript â†’ AI Generates Summaries â†’ 
Saves to Database â†’ User Reviews & Approves â†’ 
Action Items Appear on Page
```

**Automatic, reliable, no user action required**

### FALLBACK PATH (1% of Cases) - Manual Upload
```
User Uploads Transcript â†’ Backend Saves â†’ 
AI Generates Summaries â†’ User Reviews & Approves â†’ 
Action Items Appear on Page
```

**Manual, for edge cases only**

   - Check Render dashboard
   - Verify latest deployment is live

2. **Test PRIMARY Path:**
   - Wait for Recall.ai webhook to fire
   - Verify summaries appear
   - Verify action items appear

3. **Test FALLBACK Path:**
   - Upload transcript manually
   - Verify no 500 error
   - Verify summaries generate

4. **Monitor Logs:**
   - Check Render logs for errors
   - Check Supabase logs for RLS issues
