## SUCCESS METRICS

### Launch Readiness
- âœ… 100% of Phase 1 complete
- âœ… 80% of Phase 2 complete
- âœ… All critical tests passing
- âœ… Security audit passed
- âœ… Performance benchmarks met

### Post-Launch
- Error rate < 0.1%
- API response time < 500ms
- Uptime > 99.9%
- User satisfaction > 4.5/5
- Churn rate < 5%

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### High Risk Items
1. **Stripe Integration** - Use Stripe test mode first
2. **Database Migration** - Test on staging first
3. **Performance** - Load test before launch
4. **Security** - Third-party security audit

### Contingency Plans
1. **Billing Failure** - Manual billing fallback
2. **Calendar Sync Failure** - Manual sync button
3. **Database Failure** - Automated backups + recovery
4. **API Failure** - Graceful degradation
