## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Syntax error"
**Solution:** Make sure you copied the ENTIRE script (starts with BEGIN; ends with COMMIT;)

### Issue: "Table already exists"
**Solution:** Drop schema and recreate:
```sql
DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA public;
-- Then run the script again
```

### Issue: "User can't log in"
**Solution:** Check users table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
-- If empty, user needs to re-register
```

### Issue: "Meetings not showing"
**Solution:** Check calendar connection:
```sql
SELECT * FROM calendar_connections;
-- If empty, user needs to connect calendar
```
