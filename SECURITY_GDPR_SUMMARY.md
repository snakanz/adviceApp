# üîê SECURITY & GDPR COMPLIANCE - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Focus:** Making Advicly production-ready for public sign-ups  
**Current Status:** 70% ready  
**Timeline to Launch:** 4 weeks  
**Effort:** 42 hours development + legal review

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

‚úÖ **Authentication is solid** - Supabase Auth + Google OAuth working well  
‚ùå **Security hardening needed** - Email verification, rate limiting, MFA  
‚ùå **GDPR compliance missing** - Data export/deletion, privacy policy, audit logging  
‚è≥ **Outlook integration** - Can be added post-launch (not critical for MVP)

---

## CURRENT STATE: WHAT'S WORKING ‚úÖ

### Authentication
- ‚úÖ Google OAuth (via Supabase Auth)
- ‚úÖ Email/Password signup
- ‚úÖ JWT token verification
- ‚úÖ PKCE flow (secure)
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant isolation (RLS)
- ‚úÖ User-scoped database clients

### Security
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security policies
- ‚úÖ User data isolation
- ‚úÖ HTTPS enforcement
- ‚úÖ Security headers
- ‚úÖ Token expiry (1 hour)
- ‚úÖ Refresh token rotation

### Account Creation
- ‚úÖ Google OAuth signup
- ‚úÖ Email/password signup
- ‚úÖ Onboarding flow
- ‚úÖ Business profile collection
- ‚úÖ Calendar connection
- ‚úÖ Initial meeting sync

## CRITICAL GAPS: WHAT'S MISSING ‚ùå

### Security Hardening (CRITICAL)
1. **Email Verification** - Anyone can sign up with any email
   - Fix: Enable in Supabase (5 minutes)
   - Impact: Prevents spam/fake accounts

2. **Rate Limiting** - No protection against brute force
   - Fix: Add express-rate-limit (2 hours)
   - Impact: Prevents account takeover

3. **Password Policy** - Users can set weak passwords
   - Fix: Configure in Supabase (1 hour)
   - Impact: Stronger passwords

4. **MFA** - No second factor authentication
   - Fix: Add TOTP support (8 hours)
   - Impact: Much more secure

5. **Audit Logging** - Can't track who did what
   - Fix: Create audit_logs table (6 hours)
   - Impact: Compliance + security investigation

### GDPR Compliance (CRITICAL)
1. **Data Export** - Users can't get their data
   - Fix: Create /api/gdpr/export endpoint (4 hours)
   - Impact: GDPR requirement

2. **Data Deletion** - Users can't delete their account
   - Fix: Create /api/gdpr/delete endpoint (3 hours)
   - Impact: GDPR requirement

3. **Privacy Policy** - No legal document
   - Fix: Create page + legal review (4 hours + $200-500)
   - Impact: Legal requirement

4. **Terms of Service** - No legal document
   - Fix: Create page + legal review (4 hours + $200-500)
   - Impact: Legal requirement

5. **Consent Management** - Not tracking user consent
   - Fix: Add consent checkbox + tracking (3 hours)
   - Impact: GDPR requirement

---

## OUTLOOK INTEGRATION: HOW HARD?

### Difficulty: MEDIUM (8-12 hours)

**What's needed:**
1. Register app in Azure Portal (30 min)
2. Add Microsoft OAuth to Supabase (30 min)
3. Update frontend OAuth logic (1 hour)
4. Update backend OAuth logic (1 hour)
5. Add Outlook calendar sync (4-6 hours)
6. Testing (2 hours)

**Why not critical:**
- Google OAuth sufficient for MVP
- Most financial advisors use Gmail
- Can be added post-launch
- Adds complexity

**Recommendation:** Launch with Google, add Outlook in Phase 2

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Risk (Must Fix)
1. **No email verification** - Spam accounts
2. **No rate limiting** - Account takeover
3. **No GDPR compliance** - Legal liability
4. **No audit logging** - Can't investigate issues

### Medium Risk (Should Fix)
1. **No MFA** - Password breach vulnerability
2. **No password policy** - Weak passwords
3. **No monitoring** - Can't see production issues

### Low Risk (Can Fix Later)
1. **No Outlook integration** - Not critical for MVP
2. **No advanced security** - Can add later
3. **No compliance dashboard** - Nice to have
