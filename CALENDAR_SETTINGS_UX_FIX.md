# 🎯 Calendar Settings UX Fix - Existing Calendly Connections

## 🔴 Problem

When a user (like snaka1003@gmail.com) had already connected their Calendly account via OAuth:

1. **Settings page showed misleading UI** - Displayed "Connect Calendly" button as if not connected
2. **No connection status displayed** - Didn't show that Calendly was already authorized
3. **No action options** - Users couldn't reconnect or manually trigger sync
4. **Confusing UX** - The Calendly card appeared in "Switch Calendar" section even when already connected

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **1. Detect Existing Calendly Connections**

The component now checks if a Calendly connection exists:
```javascript
connections.some(c => c.provider === 'calendly' && c.is_active)
```

### **2. Show in "Current Connection" Section**

When Calendly is connected (`is_active = true`):
- ✅ Displays in the "Current Connection" section (like Google Calendar)
- ✅ Shows "Connected" status with green badge
- ✅ Displays account email (if available)
- ✅ Shows last sync time

### **3. Add Action Buttons for Calendly**

When Calendly is connected, users see:

| Button | Function | Use Case |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Manual Sync** | Triggers immediate sync | User wants to fetch latest meetings now |
| **Reconnect** | Re-authorizes with Calendly | Token expired or needs to re-authenticate |
| **Disable Sync** | Toggles sync on/off | User wants to pause syncing |
| **Disconnect** | Removes connection | User wants to switch to different calendar |

### **4. Hide Calendly from "Switch Calendar" Section**

When Calendly is already connected:
- ✅ Calendly card is hidden from "Switch Calendar" section
- ✅ Only shows if no active Calendly connection exists
- ✅ Reduces confusion about connection status

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### **Before Fix**
```
Settings → Calendar Integrations
├── Current Connection: No calendar connected
└── Switch Calendar
    ├── Google Calendar (Connect)
    └── Calendly (Connect) ← Misleading! Already connected
```

### **After Fix**
```
Settings → Calendar Integrations
├── Current Connection
│   └── 📅 Calendly [Connected]
│       ├── Manual Sync button
│       ├── Reconnect button
│       ├── Disable Sync button
│       └── Disconnect button
└── Switch Calendar
    └── Google Calendar (Connect)
```
