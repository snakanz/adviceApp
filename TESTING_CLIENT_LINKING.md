## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Link Client" button doesn't appear
**Solution**: Meeting already has a linked client. Look for a meeting with "No client linked" status.

### Issue: Dialog shows "No clients found"
**Solution**: This is normal if you have no existing clients. Use "Create New" mode instead.

### Issue: Error "Failed to link client"
**Solution**: 
- Check internet connection
- Verify email format is valid
- Try again in a few seconds
- Check browser console for detailed error

### Issue: Action Items page still shows errors
**Solution**:
- Verify at least one meeting has a linked client
- Verify action items exist for that meeting
- Try refreshing the page
- Check that the meeting has a transcript
