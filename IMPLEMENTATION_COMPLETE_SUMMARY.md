## 📊 Client Name Extraction Priority

When extracting client names from attendees:

1. **Google Calendar displayName** (Best)
   - Uses full name from Google Contacts
   - Example: "John Smith"

2. **Meeting Title Pattern** (Good)
   - Extracts from patterns like "Meeting with John"
   - Example: "Meeting with Sarah Johnson" → "Sarah Johnson"

3. **Email Username** (Fallback)
   - Formats email username
   - Example: "john.smith@example.com" → "John Smith"
