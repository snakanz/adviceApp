# Business Type Expected Close Date - Feature Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Feature Complete!**

Added the ability to set an **expected close date** for each business type when managing client business types.

---

## ✅ **What Was Implemented**

### **Problem:**
When adding or editing business types for a client, there was no way to set when each business type is expected to close. This made it difficult to:
- Track when different business types will complete
- Organize business types by expected close date
- Plan pipeline activities based on close dates

### **Solution:**
Added an **Expected Close Date** field to each business type with:
1. ✅ Database column to store the date
2. ✅ Date picker in Business Type Manager modal
3. ✅ Date picker in Create Client form
4. ✅ Backend support for saving and retrieving dates
5. ✅ Updated database view to include close date aggregations

---

## 📁 **Files Modified**

### **Database Migration:**
- ✅ `backend/migrations/010_add_business_type_close_date.sql` - **NEW FILE**
  - Adds `expected_close_date` column to `client_business_types` table
  - Creates index for performance
  - Updates `client_business_summary` view

### **Frontend Components:**
- ✅ `src/components/BusinessTypeManager.js`
  - Added `expected_close_date` to empty business type template
  - Added date input field in the form (next to IAF Expected)
  
- ✅ `src/components/CreateClientForm.js`
  - Added `expected_close_date` to empty business type template
  - Added date input field in the create client form

### **Backend Routes:**

  - Updated business type creation to include `expected_close_date`
  - Updated business type update to include `expected_close_date`
  - Two locations updated (create client and update business types)

---

## 🗄️ **Database Changes**

### **New Column:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE client_business_types 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS expected_close_date DATE;
```

**Properties:**
- **Type:** `DATE`
- **Nullable:** `YES` (existing records will have NULL)
- **Default:** `NULL`

### **New Index:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_client_business_types_expected_close_date 
ON client_business_types(expected_close_date);
```

**Purpose:** Improves query performance when filtering or sorting by close date

### **Updated View:**
The `client_business_summary` view now includes:
- `earliest_close_date` - The earliest expected close date across all business types for a client
- `latest_close_date` - The latest expected close date across all business types for a client

## 🎨 **User Interface Changes**

### **Business Type Manager Modal**

**Before:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Business Type 1                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Business Type: [Pension      ▼]    │
│ Business Amount: [250000]           │
│ Contribution Method: [Lump Sum ▼]  │
│ IAF Expected: [7000]                │
│ Notes: [...]                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**After:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Business Type 1                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Business Type: [Pension      ▼]    │
│ Business Amount: [250000]           │
│ Contribution Method: [Lump Sum ▼]  │
│ IAF Expected: [7000]  Date: [📅]   │  ← NEW!
│ Notes: [...]                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Field Layout:**
The IAF Expected and Expected Close Date fields are displayed **side-by-side** in a 2-column grid:

```
┌──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┐
│ IAF Expected (£)     │ Expected Close Date  │
│ [7000]               │ [📅 2025-12-31]      │
└──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┘
```

### **Date Picker:**
- Uses native HTML5 `<input type="date">` for maximum compatibility
- Shows calendar picker on click
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2025-12-31)
- Optional field - can be left blank

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Frontend Data Flow:**

1. **Empty Business Type Template:**
```javascript
{
  id: null,
  business_type: '',
  business_amount: '',
  contribution_method: '',
  regular_contribution_amount: '',
  iaf_expected: '',
  expected_close_date: '',  // ← NEW!
  notes: ''
}
```

2. **Date Input Component:**
```jsx
<Input
  id={`expected_close_date_${index}`}
  type="date"
  value={businessType.expected_close_date || ''}
  onChange={(e) => updateBusinessType(index, 'expected_close_date', e.target.value)}
  placeholder="Select expected close date"
/>
```

### **Backend Data Processing:**

**When Creating/Updating Business Types:**
```javascript
const businessTypeData = businessTypes.map(bt => ({
  client_id: clientId,
  business_type: bt.business_type,
  business_amount: bt.business_amount ? parseFloat(bt.business_amount) : null,
  contribution_method: bt.contribution_method || null,
  regular_contribution_amount: bt.regular_contribution_amount || null,
  iaf_expected: bt.iaf_expected ? parseFloat(bt.iaf_expected) : null,
  expected_close_date: bt.expected_close_date || null,  // ← NEW!
  notes: bt.notes || null
}));
```
