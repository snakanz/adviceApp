# Calendly Sync Implementation Summary

## Issues Addressed

### ✅ Issue 1: Calendly Meeting Sync Not Refreshing Properly

**Problem**: Calendly meetings were only syncing when manually triggered via the "Sync Calendly" button. There was no automatic background sync to keep meetings up-to-date.

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Automatic Periodic Sync (Every 15 Minutes)**
   - Created `backend/src/services/syncScheduler.js` - A scheduler service using `node-cron`
   - Automatically syncs Calendly meetings for all users every 15 minutes
   - Starts automatically when backend server launches (after 5-second delay)
   - Handles new meetings, updates, and deletions

2. **Real-time Webhook Support (Optional)**
   - Added webhook endpoints to `backend/src/routes/calendly.js`
   - Supports instant updates when meetings are created/cancelled in Calendly
   - Includes signature verification for security
   - Provides setup instructions via `/api/calendly/webhook/test` endpoint

3. **Scheduler Management API**
   - `GET /api/calendly/scheduler/status` - Check if scheduler is running
   - `POST /api/calendly/scheduler/trigger` - Manually trigger sync immediately

**Files Created**:
- `backend/src/services/syncScheduler.js` - Automatic sync scheduler service
- `backend/CALENDLY_SYNC_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup documentation

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/index.js` - Initialize scheduler on server startup
- `backend/src/routes/calendly.js` - Added scheduler status/trigger endpoints and webhook handlers
- `backend/package.json` - Added `node-cron` dependency

**How It Works**:
```
Server Starts
    ↓
Scheduler Initializes (5 sec delay)
    ↓
Every 15 Minutes:
    ↓
Fetch All Users → Sync Calendly for Each User → Log Results
    ↓
Update Database with New/Updated/Deleted Meetings
    ↓
Extract and Link Clients
```

### ✅ Issue 2: Clean Up Migration File

**Problem**: The migration file `database/migrations/021_full_document_consolidation.sql` contained unnecessary verification queries and status output (STEP 4) that should not be in production migrations.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Removed all verification SELECT statements
- Removed status output queries
- Removed summary displays
- Kept only essential schema changes (STEP 1-3) and documentation comments
- Migration is now clean and production-ready

**Files Modified**:
- `database/migrations/021_full_document_consolidation.sql` - Removed STEP 4 verification queries

**What Was Removed**:
- `SELECT '=== DOCUMENT SYSTEM SETUP COMPLETE ===' as info;`
- Total documents count query
- Documents with meeting association query
- Upload source distribution query
- Storage bucket distribution query

**What Remains**:
- Schema changes (columns, constraints, indexes)
- Documentation comments
- Migration notes

## Testing the Implementation

### Test Automatic Sync

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Check logs for scheduler initialization**:
   ```
   🚀 Starting automatic sync scheduler...
   ✅ Sync scheduler started successfully
   📅 Calendly sync will run every 15 minutes
   ```

3. **Wait for first sync** (or trigger manually):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/calendly/scheduler/trigger \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
   ```

4. **Monitor logs for sync activity**:
   ```
   🔄 [Scheduled Sync] Starting automatic Calendly sync...
   📊 [Scheduled Sync] Found 1 user(s) to sync
   ✅ [Scheduled Sync] Completed: X new, Y updated, 0 errors
   ```

### Test Scheduler Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/api/calendly/scheduler/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "scheduler": {
    "isRunning": true,
    "scheduledTasks": [
      {
        "name": "Calendly Sync",
        "schedule": "Every 15 minutes"
      }
    ],
    "calendlyConfigured": true
  }
}
```

### Test Webhook Setup (Optional)

1. **Get webhook URL**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8787/api/calendly/webhook/test
   ```

2. **Configure in Calendly**:
   - Go to Calendly Integrations > Webhooks
   - Create webhook with URL from above
   - Subscribe to `invitee.created` and `invitee.canceled`
   - Copy signing key to `.env` as `CALENDLY_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY`

3. **Test by booking a meeting** in Calendly and checking backend logs

### Test Migration File

Run the cleaned migration:
```bash
psql -h your-db-host -U your-user -d your-database -f database/migrations/021_full_document_consolidation.sql
```

Should execute cleanly without any SELECT output.

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Required for Calendly sync
CALENDLY_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_calendly_token_here

# Optional - only needed for webhook verification
CALENDLY_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY=your_webhook_signing_key_here
```

### Getting Calendly Token

1. Log in to Calendly
2. Go to Integrations > API & Webhooks
3. Generate New Token
4. Copy to `.env` file

## Benefits

### Automatic Sync
- ✅ Meetings stay up-to-date without manual intervention
- ✅ Runs in background every 15 minutes
- ✅ Handles all users automatically
- ✅ Detects new, updated, and cancelled meetings
- ✅ Automatically extracts and links clients

### Webhook Support
- ✅ Near-instant updates when meetings are created/cancelled
- ✅ Reduces API calls (only sync what changed)
- ✅ Better user experience (no waiting for periodic sync)
- ✅ Secure signature verification

### Clean Migration
- ✅ Production-ready migration file
- ✅ No debug output in production
- ✅ Faster migration execution
- ✅ Cleaner logs

## Monitoring

### Backend Logs

The scheduler logs detailed information:

```
🔄 [Scheduled Sync] Starting automatic Calendly sync...
📊 [Scheduled Sync] Found 1 user(s) to sync
  🔄 Syncing for user 1 (user@example.com)...
  ✅ User 1: 3 new, 2 updated
✅ [Scheduled Sync] Completed: 3 new, 2 updated, 0 errors
⏰ Next sync in 15 minutes
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/calendly/scheduler/status` - Check scheduler health
- `POST /api/calendly/scheduler/trigger` - Force immediate sync
- `GET /api/calendly/status` - Check Calendly connection
- `GET /api/calendly/webhook/test` - Get webhook setup info

## Customization

### Change Sync Frequency

Edit `backend/src/services/syncScheduler.js`:

```javascript
// Current: Every 15 minutes
const calendlyTask = cron.schedule('*/15 * * * *', async () => {
  await this.syncCalendlyForAllUsers();
});

// Change to every 30 minutes:
const calendlyTask = cron.schedule('*/30 * * * *', async () => {
  await this.syncCalendlyForAllUsers();
});

// Change to every hour:
const calendlyTask = cron.schedule('0 * * * *', async () => {
  await this.syncCalendlyForAllUsers();
});
```

Cron format: `minute hour day month weekday`

### Change Time Range

Edit `backend/src/services/calendlyService.js`:

```javascript
// Current: 2 years back, 1 year forward
const timeMin = options.timeMin || new Date(now.getTime() - 730 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
const timeMax = options.timeMax || new Date(now.getTime() + 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

// Change to 1 year back, 6 months forward:
const timeMin = options.timeMin || new Date(now.getTime() - 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
const timeMax = options.timeMax || new Date(now.getTime() + 180 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

## Documentation

Full setup and troubleshooting guide: `backend/CALENDLY_SYNC_SETUP.md`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Deploy updated backend to Render
2. ✅ Add `CALENDLY_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` to Render environment variables
3. ✅ Verify scheduler starts on deployment
4. ✅ Monitor logs for successful syncs
5. ⚪ (Optional) Set up Calendly webhooks for real-time updates
6. ⚪ (Optional) Add sync status indicator to frontend UI

## Summary

Both issues have been successfully resolved:

1. **Calendly Sync**: Now runs automatically every 15 minutes with optional webhook support for real-time updates
2. **Migration File**: Cleaned up and production-ready without debug queries

The implementation is robust, well-documented, and ready for production deployment.
