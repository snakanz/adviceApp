**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Commit:** `d5fa829`

---

## Overview
This document summarizes three separate improvements made to the Advicly platform:
1. SQL script to delete Samantha Jones action items for testing
2. Fix scroll issue in Pipeline page "Needs Attention" section
3. Add "Review Meetings" tab to Action Items page

---

## ✅ Task 1: Delete Samantha Jones Action Items

### **Purpose**
Create a SQL script to delete all existing action items for client Samantha Jones, allowing you to test the new AI action items extraction prompt with a clean slate.

### **What Was Created**
**File:** `backend/DELETE_SAMANTHA_JONES_ACTION_ITEMS.sql`

### **Features**
1. ✅ **Step 1:** Find Samantha Jones client ID by name or email
2. ✅ **Step 2:** Show all action items that will be deleted (verification)
3. ✅ **Step 3:** Delete action items (commented out for safety)
4. ✅ **Step 4:** Verify deletion was successful
5. ✅ **Alternative:** Delete by specific client UUID if known

### **How to Use**

#### **Option 1: Run in Supabase SQL Editor**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `backend/DELETE_SAMANTHA_JONES_ACTION_ITEMS.sql`
3. Run **Step 1** to find Samantha Jones' client ID
4. Run **Step 2** to see what will be deleted
5. Uncomment and run **Step 3** to delete the action items
6. Run **Step 4** to verify deletion

#### **Option 2: Use the Script Directly**
```sql
-- Find Samantha Jones
SELECT id, name, email FROM clients 
WHERE name ILIKE '%samantha%jones%' OR email ILIKE '%samantha%jones%';

-- Delete action items (replace with actual client ID)
DELETE FROM transcript_action_items
WHERE client_id = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE';
```

### **After Deletion**
1. Go to Samantha Jones' meeting in Advicly
2. Click **"Auto-Generate Summaries"** button
3. The new AI prompt will extract fresh action items
4. Verify the new action items are more focused and concrete

---

## ✅ Task 2: Fix Pipeline Page Scroll Issue

### **Problem**
On the Client Pipeline page, when clicking on the "Needs Attention" section to expand the dropdown list of clients, users could not scroll through the clients if the list was too long.

### **Solution**
Added `max-h-96 overflow-y-auto` classes to the collapsible client list container.

### **File Modified**
`src/pages/Pipeline.js` (line 612)

### **Code Change**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
<div className="mt-3 space-y-2">

// AFTER:
<div className="mt-3 space-y-2 max-h-96 overflow-y-auto">
```

### **Impact**
- ✅ Users can now scroll through all clients in the "Needs Attention" section
- ✅ Maximum height of 384px (24rem) prevents section from taking over entire screen
- ✅ Smooth scrolling with proper overflow handling
- ✅ Maintains existing design and functionality

### **Testing**
1. Go to **Pipeline** page
2. Click on **"Needs Attention"** section header to expand
3. If you have many overdue/undated clients, verify you can scroll through the list
4. Scroll should be smooth and show all clients

---

## ✅ Task 3: Add Review Meetings Tab to Action Items

### **Purpose**
Add a new tab to the Action Items page that shows all meetings marked for review (starred meetings). These are meetings where the user clicked the star icon to flag them as needing special attention, custom emails, or specific action items.

### **Backend Changes**

#### **New API Endpoint**
**File:** `backend/src/routes/calendar.js`

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/calendar/meetings/starred`

**Authentication:** Required (JWT token)

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 123,
    "googleEventId": "abc123",
    "title": "Meeting with Samantha Jones",
    "startTime": "2025-10-15T10:00:00Z",
    "endTime": "2025-10-15T11:00:00Z",
    "hasTranscript": true,
    "hasQuickSummary": true,
    "hasEmailSummary": false,

      "id": "uuid-here",
      "name": "Samantha Jones",
      "email": "sam@example.com"
    }
  }
]
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Fetches all meetings where `is_annual_review = true`
- ✅ Includes client information via join
- ✅ Shows transcript/summary completion status
- ✅ Ordered by meeting date (most recent first)
- ✅ Filtered by current user (advisor_id)

   - ✅ Instructs users to star meetings in the Meetings page

4. **State Management**
   - ✅ Fetches starred meetings on component mount

   - ✅ Tab state persists during session

### **UI/UX Improvements**

┌─────────────────┬──────────────────────┐

└─────────────────┴──────────────────────┘
```
