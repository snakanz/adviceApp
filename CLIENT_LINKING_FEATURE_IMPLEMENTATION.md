# Client Linking Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the **Client Linking Feature** for Advicly, which allows users to link meetings to clients and automatically link all meetings with the same attendee email.

**Status**: ✅ Complete and deployed to GitHub (commit `98cffbe`)

---

## Problem Statement

### Root Cause
Meetings synced from Google Calendar have `client_id = NULL` because the sync process doesn't automatically link meetings to clients. This causes the Action Items page to fail with:

```
Error: Could not find a relationship between 'transcript_action_items' and 'clients'
```

### Why It Happens
The Action Items page calls three endpoints that try to JOIN the `transcript_action_items` table with the `clients` table using the `client_id` foreign key:
- `GET /action-items/by-client`
- `GET /action-items/all`
- `GET /pending/all`

When `client_id` is NULL, Supabase PostgREST cannot establish the relationship, causing the query to fail.

---

## Solution

### User Workflow
1. User opens a meeting in the Meetings page
2. If the meeting has no linked client, a "Link Client" button appears
3. User clicks "Link Client" to open the LinkClientDialog
4. User can either:
   - **Select Existing Client**: Choose from existing clients
   - **Create New Client**: Enter client name and email
5. System links the meeting to the client
6. System automatically links all other meetings with the same attendee email
7. Action Items page now works because meetings have `client_id` populated

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Endpoint: `POST /api/calendar/meetings/:meetingId/link-client`

**Location**: `backend/src/routes/calendar.js` (lines 2213-2381)

**Functionality**:
- Validates input (requires either `clientId` or `clientEmail`)
- Finds or creates the client
- Links the meeting to the client
- Auto-links all other meetings with the same attendee email
- Returns success response with count of linked meetings

**Request Body**:
```javascript
// Option 1: Link to existing client
{ clientId: "uuid-123" }

// Option 2: Create new client
{ clientEmail: "john@example.com", clientName: "John Smith" }
```

**Response**:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  message: "Linked 3 meeting(s) to client",
  clientId: "uuid-123",
  linkedCount: 3
}
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Handles both existing and new clients
- ✅ Auto-links meetings with same attendee email
- ✅ Creates new clients with default pipeline_stage and priority_level
- ✅ Includes comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Logs all operations for debugging

---

### 2. Frontend Component: `LinkClientDialog`

**Location**: `src/components/LinkClientDialog.js`

**Features**:
- Two modes: "Select Existing" and "Create New"
- Shows meeting details (title, date/time)
- Loads existing clients from API
- Displays loading states and error messages
- Success confirmation with linked count
- Integrates with Supabase Auth for token management

**Props**:
```javascript
{
  meeting: Meeting,           // Meeting object to link
  open: boolean,              // Dialog visibility
  onOpenChange: function,     // Callback to close dialog
  onClientLinked: function    // Callback after successful link
}
```

---

### 3. Frontend Integration: `Meetings.js`

**Changes**:
1. Added import for `LinkClientDialog` (line 43)
2. Added state variables (lines 337-338):
   - `showLinkClientDialog`: Controls dialog visibility
   - `linkClientMeeting`: Stores meeting being linked
3. Added "Link Client" button to meeting detail panel (lines 1779-1792)
   - Only shows when `meeting.client` is null
   - Opens dialog with meeting data
4. Added LinkClientDialog component at end (lines 3185-3196)
   - Calls `fetchMeetings()` on successful link to refresh UI

---

## Database Schema

### Existing Tables Used
- `meetings`: Has `client_id` column (nullable, references `clients.id`)
- `clients`: Stores client information
- `users`: Stores user information

### No Schema Changes Required
The feature uses existing database schema. No migrations needed.

---

## How It Works: Step-by-Step

### Scenario: User links "john@example.com" to a meeting

1. **User clicks "Link Client"** on a meeting
2. **LinkClientDialog opens** showing:
   - Meeting title and date
   - Option to select existing client or create new
3. **User selects "Create New"** and enters:
   - Name: "John Smith"
   - Email: "john@example.com"
4. **Backend endpoint is called**:
   ```
   POST /api/calendar/meetings/123/link-client
   { clientEmail: "john@example.com", clientName: "John Smith" }
   ```
5. **Backend processes**:
   - Checks if client exists (by email)
   - Creates new client if not found
   - Links meeting #123 to client
   - Finds all other meetings with "john@example.com" in attendees
   - Links those meetings too (e.g., meetings #45, #67)
6. **Response returns**:
   ```
   { success: true, linkedCount: 3, clientId: "uuid-123" }
   ```
7. **Frontend shows success** and refreshes meetings
8. **All three meetings now have** `client_id = "uuid-123"`
9. **Action Items page now works** because JOIN queries succeed

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Advicly account with meetings synced from Google Calendar
- At least one meeting with no linked client

### Test Steps

1. **Navigate to Meetings page**
2. **Find a meeting with "No client linked"**
3. **Click "Link Client" button**
4. **Test Mode 1: Create New Client**
   - Select "Create New" tab
   - Enter name: "Test Client"
   - Enter email: "test@example.com"
   - Click "Link Client"
   - Verify success message shows "Linked X meeting(s)"
5. **Test Mode 2: Select Existing**
   - Click "Link Client" on another meeting
   - Select "Select Existing" tab
   - Choose a client from dropdown
   - Click "Link Client"
   - Verify success message
6. **Verify Auto-linking**
   - Go to Clients page
   - Find the linked client
   - Check that multiple meetings are associated
7. **Verify Action Items Page**
   - Navigate to Action Items page
   - Verify it loads without errors
   - Verify action items are grouped by client

## Success Criteria

✅ Users can link meetings to clients via UI button
