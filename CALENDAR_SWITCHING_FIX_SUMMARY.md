# Calendar Switching Fix - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Confusing UI for Multi-Calendar Users
**Before:** Users with both Google and Calendly connected couldn't easily see or switch between them
- Calendly card only showed if NOT active
- No clear way to toggle between calendars
- Confusing "Add Calendar" interface

**After:** Simple, clean toggle interface
- "Switch Calendar" section shows ALL connected calendars
- One-click "Switch" button to activate any calendar
- Shows connection status (Active/Inactive) for each
- "Add Calendar" section only shows calendars NOT yet connected

### Issue 2: No Auto-Sync When Switching to Google Calendar
**Before:** Switching to Google Calendar didn't fetch new meetings
- User had to manually click "Sync" button
- New meetings created in Google Calendar didn't appear
- Confusing user experience

**After:** Automatic sync on switch
- Switching to Google Calendar triggers automatic sync
- New meetings fetched immediately
- Backend deactivates other connections automatically
- Seamless one-click experience

## 📝 Changes Made

### Frontend: `src/components/CalendarSettings.js`

#### 1. New Handler: `handleSwitchCalendar()`
```javascript
const handleSwitchCalendar = async (connectionId, provider) => {
  // Activate this connection
  await axios.patch(
    `/api/calendar-connections/${connectionId}/toggle-sync`,
    { sync_enabled: true }
  );
  
  // If Google Calendar, trigger sync
  if (provider === 'google') {
    await axios.post(`/api/calendar/sync-google`, {});
  }
  
  loadConnections();
};
```

#### 2. New UI Section: "Switch Calendar"
- Shows only when user has 2+ calendars connected
- Displays each calendar with:
  - Provider icon and name
  - Account email
  - "Active" badge if currently active
  - "Switch" button if inactive
- Clean card-based layout

#### 3. Updated "Add Calendar" Section
- Only shows calendars NOT yet connected
- Cleaner, less cluttered interface
- Maintains existing connection/OAuth flows

### Backend: `backend/src/routes/calendar-settings.js`

#### Updated: `PATCH /api/calendar-connections/:id/toggle-sync`

**New Behavior:**
1. When enabling a connection:
   - Deactivates ALL other connections for the user
   - Ensures only one active calendar at a time
   
2. For Google Calendar specifically:
   - Triggers background sync automatically
   - Fetches meetings from past 6 months
   - Non-blocking (doesn't wait for sync to complete)

```javascript
// If enabling Google Calendar, trigger background sync
if (sync_enabled && data.provider === 'google') {
  const syncService = new CalendarSyncService();
  syncService.syncUserCalendar(userId, {
    timeRange: 'extended',
    includeDeleted: true
  }).then(syncResult => {
    console.log('✅ Google Calendar sync completed:', syncResult);
  }).catch(syncErr => {
    console.warn('⚠️ Sync failed (non-fatal):', syncErr.message);
  });
}
```

5. Clicks Google Calendar button
6. Gets redirected to OAuth (confusing!)
7. Has to manually click "Sync" button
8. Waits for meetings to appear

**After:**

2. Wants to switch from Calendly to Google
3. Goes to Settings → Calendar Integrations
4. Sees "Switch Calendar" section with both calendars
