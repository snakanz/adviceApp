---

## ✅ Issue 1: Clients Page - Calendar/List View Toggle

### **What Was Requested**
- Remove current top-right view controls
- Add two new view toggle buttons: "Calendar View" (default) and "List View"
- Implement weekly calendar layout showing all meetings (past, today, future)
- Clicking meetings in calendar should open detail panel

### **What Was Implemented**

#### **View Toggle Buttons**
- Added professional toggle buttons in header with Calendar and List icons
- Styled with border container and active/inactive states
- Calendar View is the default view on page load

#### **Weekly Calendar Layout**
- **7-day grid** (Sunday through Saturday)
- **Week navigation**: Previous/Next week buttons + "Today" button
- **Month/Year header** showing current week's month
- **Day headers** with day name and date number
- **Today highlighting** with primary color accent

#### **Meeting Cards in Calendar**
- Each meeting displays:
  - ⏰ Time (HH:MM format)
  - 📝 Meeting title (truncated to 2 lines)
  - 👤 Client avatar with initials
  - 👤 Client name
  - ✅ Completion status badge (if transcript + summaries exist)
- **Hover effects** with border color change and shadow
- **Click to open** client detail panel (same as list view)

#### **Calendar Helper Functions**
```javascript
getWeekDays()           // Returns array of 7 dates for current week
getMeetingsForDay(day)  // Returns all meetings for a specific day
isToday(date)           // Checks if date is today
goToPreviousWeek()      // Navigate to previous week
goToNextWeek()          // Navigate to next week
goToToday()             // Jump to current week
```

#### **List View**
- Maintains existing table functionality
- All sorting, filtering, and search features preserved
- Seamless toggle between views

### **Commit**

## ✅ Issue 2: Pipeline Page - "Needs Attention" Section Behavior

### **What Was Requested**
- Do NOT automatically show/expand the "Needs Attention" section on page load
- Move the section to appear BELOW the monthly tabs (currently at top)
- Keep collapsible functionality, but default state should be collapsed

### **What Was Implemented**

#### **Default State Changed**
- Changed `showOverdueSection` initial state from `true` to `false`
- Section is now collapsed by default on page load
- User must manually click to expand

#### **Section Repositioned**
- Moved entire "Needs Attention" section from above monthly tabs to below them
- New order:
  1. Monthly tabs (Nov 2025, Dec 2025, etc.)
  2. "Needs Attention" section (collapsed by default)
  3. Search and filters
  4. Pipeline table

#### **Functionality Preserved**
- Collapsible header with click to expand/collapse
- Shows count of overdue/undated clients
- Displays total value
- Gradient amber/orange design maintained
- All client cards and data intact

### **Files Modified**
- `src/pages/Pipeline.js` (line 33: default state, lines 445-586: section moved)

### **Commit**
- Commit: `6e50deb`
- Message: "Pipeline page improvements: move Needs Attention section below tabs, collapse by default, make client name clickable"

## ✅ Issue 3: Pipeline Detail Panel - Clickable Client Name

### **What Was Requested**
- Make the client name clickable in the Pipeline detail panel header
- Clicking should navigate to that client's detail page in the Clients section

### **What Was Implemented**

#### **Clickable Client Name**
- Added `onClick` handler to client name heading
- Navigates to `/clients?clientId={selectedClient.id}`
- Uses `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent panel click events

#### **Visual Enhancements**
- **Hover effect**: Text color changes to primary color
- **Underline animation**: Decoration appears on hover
- **Cursor**: Changes to pointer to indicate clickability
- **Title attribute**: Shows "View client details" tooltip

#### **Code Implementation**
```javascript
<h3 
  className="font-bold text-lg text-foreground truncate hover:text-primary cursor-pointer transition-colors underline decoration-transparent hover:decoration-primary"
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    navigate(`/clients?clientId=${selectedClient.id}`);
  }}
  title="View client details"
>
  {selectedClient.name}
</h3>
```

### **Files Modified**
- `src/pages/Pipeline.js` (lines 953-978 → 839-874)

### **Commit**
- Commit: `6e50deb` (same as Issue 2)

## ✅ Issue 4: Pipeline Detail Panel - AI-Generated "Next Steps to Close" Summary

### **What Was Requested**
- Add AI-generated summary explaining what's required to finalize the business deal
- Consider: pipeline stage, documents status, action items, business type, expected close date, blockers
- Keep concise (2-3 sentences maximum)
- Display prominently with light blue background and sparkles icon
- Similar to existing AI summary patterns

### **What Was Implemented**

#### **Backend API Endpoint**
- **New endpoint**: `POST /clients/:clientId/generate-pipeline-summary`
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **Context considered**:
  - Pipeline stage
  - IAF expected and likelihood
  - Business types with amounts and expected close dates
  - Recent action points from meetings
  - Pipeline notes
- **Prompt engineering**: Generates actionable 2-3 sentence summary focused on:
  1. Specific actions/documents needed to close
  2. Blockers or pending items
  3. Immediate next step for advisor
- **Caching**: Stores summary in `clients.pipeline_next_steps` column
- **Timestamp**: Tracks generation time in `pipeline_next_steps_generated_at`

#### **Frontend Implementation**
- **Auto-generation**: Summary generates automatically when detail panel opens
- **Smart caching**: Uses cached summary if less than 1 hour old, otherwise regenerates
- **Loading state**: Skeleton animation with pulsing bars while generating
- **Display design**:
  - Light blue gradient background (`from-blue-50 to-cyan-50`)
  - Blue border (`border-blue-200`)
  - Sparkles icon in circular badge
  - "Next Steps to Close" heading
  - Summary text in blue-800 color
  - "Regenerate" button to refresh on demand

#### **User Experience**
- Summary appears immediately after client info header
- Prominent visual placement (can't be missed)
- Loading animation provides feedback during generation
- Regenerate button allows manual refresh
- Auto-regenerates after pipeline updates

#### **Code Structure**
```javascript
// State management
const [generatingPipelineSummary, setGeneratingPipelineSummary] = useState(false);
const [pipelineSummary, setPipelineSummary] = useState(null);

// Auto-generate on client selection
const handleClientClick = async (client) => {
  // Check if cached summary is fresh (< 1 hour old)
  // If fresh, use cached; otherwise generate new
};

// Manual regeneration
const handleGeneratePipelineSummary = async (clientId) => {
  // Call API endpoint
  // Update state and client data
};
```

### **Files Modified**
- `backend/src/routes/clients.js` (lines 1529-1673: new endpoint)
- `src/pages/Pipeline.js` (imports, state, handlers, UI component)

### **Commit**
- Commit: `ec20c48`
- Message: "Add AI-generated 'Next Steps to Close' summary to Pipeline detail panel"
